If you want to become a top-producing real estate agent, you must learn to be intentional. Today I’ll share what this means and why it’s important.

You’ve probably heard of the 80/20 rule as it relates to our industry. If you’re unfamiliar with this concept, it basically states that 80% of agents in this business only handle 20% of all deals. The truth is that only a small portion of agents are responsible for the majority of transactions. **But why is this the case?**

It’s actually quite simple: Most agents aren’t as proactive as they should be. The key to being a top producer in real estate is to be intentional with every action you take. You can time block every minute of the week and still not sell any homes, and that’s because simply having a busy schedule isn’t enough. The things you fill your time with must have a specific purpose.

Your evenings and weekends will be particularly important, as this is when most clients will be available to meet with you. Everything you do should help put you in front of clients. This is easier said than done, though. You can’t expect to be successful if you aren’t well prepared at every step. Before you can set appointments, you need to make calls, and before you make calls, you need to write down a list of leads. Every action is connected.

Intentionality is a key component to success in the real estate industry. **Once you learn to be purposeful with your actions, you too can join the top 20% of agents in our business**.
