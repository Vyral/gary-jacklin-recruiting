<center><em>Here’s how you clean up your database to get more listings.</em></center>

<br>Any time of year is a great time to get listings. As the old saying goes, “You have to get busy to be busy.” As an agent, though, you need to be proactive and intentional about it.

Every agent out there has at least two or three CRMs with integrated MLS information, and **I have a simple process to clean up your database and accomplish three very important objectives:**

1. You’ll feel comfortable learning and using the CRM you choose.
2. You’ll finally gather all of your contacts into one CRM.
3. You’ll be prospecting and securing future listings. You’ll also build sales by building trust. To do business with the contacts in your database, they have to know, like, and trust you with their real estate needs.

**The process involves a few key steps**.

First, **call your database**. They already know and like you, but now they have to start trusting you with their real estate needs. Call them and get them all into one place. Start with some small talk and ask them if there’s anything you can do for them. Just focus on the call and getting everyone in the same place—not whether they want to buy or sell. Most of them are homeowners who will buy or sell in the future, but don’t worry about that. Right now, you’re just cleaning up your database, having conversations, and finding people who may need something from you.

Once you’ve selected your CRM, you’ll then update the contact information of everyone in it, including their names, phone numbers, email addresses, and mailing addresses.

Next, **update them with an automated market value of their homes**. If they’re buying, update them on what they might be looking for.

When a conversation takes place and the person on the other end of the line asks you a question, that’s your opportunity. They’ve given you permission to talk about real estate. As you have your conversations, add some notes to their contact information. Most importantly, remember that everyone lives somewhere, so if a person owns their home, send them a monthly valuation of it. The whole objective here is to get them to reach out to you. Also, find out when they plan on moving.

Stay tuned for my next video where I talk about what to do next. In the meantime, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
