Have you heard of the seven-step pricing strategy? This approach is designed to help you collaborate with your seller on the best price for them.&nbsp;

The magic behind this strategy isn’t that it is more accurate than a typical CMA; it will usually give you a similar price. Instead, **this strategy works because it allows your seller to come to this price naturally.** Instead of you going off by yourself and running CMAs until you find the perfect price, you’ll work directly with your seller to find the right price together.&nbsp;

This has many benefits over a traditional CMA. You can build rapport with your client, so they’ll be more likely to listen to your suggestions. On top of that, sellers are less likely to object to a price that they helped arrive at.&nbsp;

**Adopting the seven-step strategy will take a little more time and effort on your part, but it accomplishes two important things.** First, it assures that you arrive at an appropriate price entry point for your client’s home. Second, it gives your seller a sense of ownership over the price. This means less disagreements and headaches for you, and a smoother sale for your client.&nbsp;
