<center><em>If you&rsquo;re having trouble reaching your goals, follow these four steps.</em></center>

<br>We’ve all heard the term “goal setting” before. If you’ve been setting goals and not attaining them, though, there are four key steps you need to remember to get back on track:

**1\. You have to actually *set* your goal**. In other words, you need a clear understanding of what you *want*. You can put that into context and apply it to your personal, spiritual, or business life, but the business aspect is what funds the other two parts of your life. As big as your goals might be, you have to boil them down to their basic essence, know why they’re your goals and not someone else’s, and understand what sacrifices you’re willing to make to reach the end point. It always boils down to a business goal, or how you will fund your other main goals.

**2\. You have to put that goal into action**. When you focus on the financial goal you need to reach your bigger goals, you need a written plan. If you’re taking a vacation to Las Vegas, you naturally have to know how to get there, and the same logic applies to your goal. Once you’ve gone deep on that, you can boil it down to simple activities over time—day after day, week after week, month after month—that lead to your yearly goal. Your written plan should include your budget, where your business comes from, and where your best return on investment is outside of advertising and marketing. Specifically, I mean time: What time are you spending doing these activities? Are you getting results? Once you know the answers to these questions, it’s onto the next step.

**3\. Find a coach to help you follow your action plan**. Once you have a written action plan, you need a coach—someone who will hold you accountable to your own plan. You’ve already analyzed and determined your plan, so who’ll check in and actually press you on your progress? Very few of us can hold ourselves accountable, which is why coaches are critical.

**4\. Make a business plan template tailored to you**. How do you take everything we’ve talked about so far and synthesize it into a document that helps you think about what you want?

If you already have something in place, that’s awesome\! Stick with it; maybe all you need is someone to hold you accountable. If you don’t have a working template to organize your activities, get in touch with me and I’d be happy to provide you one.

As always, if there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me as well. I look forward to speaking with you.
