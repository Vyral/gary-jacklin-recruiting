Your database can be a huge source of business and referrals if you nurture it properly. Here’s what I recommend.

I’ve got two numbers for you: 24 and ½. What does this mean? Well, if you take the number 24 and cut it in half, you have 12. If you cut that in half, you have 6. If you cut that in half, you have 3. **What I’m really talking about here with these numbers is how often you should contact your database**. It’s a common topic of discussion amongst agents and &nbsp;a question I’m asked all the time.

In your database, remember that your main goal is growing or maintaining relationships. It’s always important to think about what everyone in your database would like and what adds value to them. **Housing and other real estate information is something that will always have value to someone in your database**.

So, how do these numbers fit in? Well, first, you should mail or email them twice a month, which equals 24 times per year. 12 is the amount of times you should call or text each person throughout the year. 6 is a reminder to call them at least six times per year, then finally the 3 means to do something else for your entire database three times per year. **Put all these together, and you have the right tools to nurture and strengthen your database**.

If you have any questions for us or want to learn a little bit more about how we use these numbers and touches to our advantage. don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
