Here’s how to be proactive through cold calling and door knocking.

Our main objective in this business is to be proactive, and cold calling and door knocking are two ways we proactively find new clients in our database.

Our goal is to meet in person with our clients, and since our money comes from when we’re voice-to-voice with clients on the phone—which is how we get face to face—we need to have a good way to accomplish this initial contact. We can speak over the phone and set up an appointment to get face to face, or we can go right to the source and knock on their door.

**Now, how do we set up our methods to make sure we can keep an effective work-life balance in our day-to-day schedules?** Here’s what I recommend:

Set aside a block of time on nights or weekends for you to make some cold calls. These blocks are now dedicated to prospecting new or potential clients. If you see nights and weekends to be too valuable of times to lose, think of it this way: When are most people available? When are people getting off work? Survey says: nights and weekends.

What about door knocking? This should also take place during nights and weekends, as people are home for the reasons mentioned earlier. Everyone lives somewhere, but not everyone is likely to be home during the day. When you find people who are getting home from work around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., you know they have both a job and a home, which means they can likely afford a purchase in the near future. **We want to be that person, face to face, who finds out when they’re planning to move**.

Whether it’s through a phone call or an in-person visit, if we find out they’re wanting to move in two years or less, we begin following up to stay on their radar. Let them know what their house is worth, send them emails with information about new homes on the market, and do anything else you can to position yourself as a helpful and professional agent.

To be successful, whether it’s through cold calling or door knocking, you have to be proactive in growing your database, maintaining it, or finding more people who will be moving soon. If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
