It’s time to plan your 2019 business. Here’s where you should start.

I’m excited to talk about how to put a business plan together today. **The simplest, easiest way to start is to figure out the dollar amount that you need to live and cover all of your expenses**.

Once you have that figured out, you should make it your goal to double it. When you set a goal in your business plan, it has to be a realistic number. Once you’ve determined that goal, it’s pretty easy to figure out how many transactions you need to complete to reach that.

For example, let's say you have an average sale price of $250,000 and an average commission of $5,000. Take your goal number, divide it by 5,000, and that’s how many transactions you’ll need to complete to get there.

Next, you’ve got to time block your life. If you owned a retail business, you know which hours that you’d be open and those would be the hours you work. **In your real estate business, you also need to figure out when you’re opened and when you’re closed**.

How many hours per week are you actually going to work? Once you block out your spiritual life, then your family life, you'll be left with at least 40 hours to work. Try to make evenings and weekends open because that’s when most people are going to be available for home showings and home for you to prospect to and be available for showings.

Be proactive, go out, grow relationships, and get voice to voice so you can get face to face. **If you stick to a plan like this, you'll be hitting your goal every year**.
