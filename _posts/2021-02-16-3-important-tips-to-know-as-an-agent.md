<br>Today’s discussion may be a little difficult to hear, but if you’re not making tons of commission dollars in the current market, you’re doing something wrong. I can pinpoint what those mistakes may be, so here are the three things you need to know to do well as a real estate agent right now:

**1\. Scheduling a face-to-face meeting is essential**. This business is all about using voice to voice to get face to face. No real estate can be transacted without a meeting. Sure, we can do many things virtually, but the vast majority of transactions will require a face-to-face meeting. That means you need to schedule an appointment, which sounds simple, but it’s very challenging for many agents. So how do you do it? Well…

**2\. Reach out to your database**. Those of you who have been calling your database are the ones rocking it these days. If you haven’t been, start calling the people in your database. Make a list of people to call, and make five calls a day.

**3\. Your message should start with the state of the market**. Letting them know what’s happening in the market is your foot in the door. You know appreciation has increased, the average time on the market has been slashed, and many people are moving for a long list of reasons. Be prepared before you call.

Here at RE/MAX Action, one of the best tools we have is the buyer script. It’s a concept, it doesn’t have to be followed word for word. Here’s the reality: You need to be proactive, make phone calls, talk to people, and have a reason why you’re calling so you can continue to help people move. If you do this, you’ll get more business.

If you have any questions or would like our buyer script, call, text, or email me, and I’ll send it to you. Let’s start rocking it\!
