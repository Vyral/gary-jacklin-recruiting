<center><em>Here are three great ways to take advantage of all the pent-up demand.</em></center>

<br>If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text\!

Since there is so much negativity right now, I’d like to start today’s message on a positive note. Whenever one of my agents gets a new listing, I like to send them a congratulations text. The other day I sent three of these texts to my agents and all three responded that they had received multiple offers and sold the homes already. While we had more listings than that, three brand-new listings sold in a single morning.

There is so much pent-up demand, which means wonderful opportunities. So I’m sharing three ways to take advantage of this pent-up demand in our real estate market—doing all three could add $35,000 to $50,000 to your gross commission income:

**1\. Update your database and reach out to them**. I say this a lot, but it’s crucial. Touch base with those contacts. Don’t let them forget that you’re there for them.

**2\. Answer their questions**. Get back to them with the answers they need. Some of the most common questions are: What’s my home currently worth, is it a good time to buy or sell, and can I sell safely right now? That last question is the most vital.

**3\. Have a written response about safety measures**. Have a document explaining safety measures for buyers and another for sellers. Why is this needed? What’s holding people back right now is fear and anxiety about everything that’s happening in this country. You need to address their doubts practically.

Showing them you have a plan will prove your professionalism and concern for their safety. Safety should always come first. If you or your company doesn’t have these written statements, contact me and I’ll get them to you. We’re having excellent success with them.
