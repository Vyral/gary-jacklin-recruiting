If you want to succeed in real estate sales, you’ve got to master the basics. Here’s why.

Whenever I think about real estate sales, I’m reminded of another one of my life’s passions: music.

How are these things connected?

Well, just like playing an instrument, working as a real estate professional all comes down to a mastery of the basics.

**Whether it’s music, sports, or real estate, having a firm grasp of the basics will give you the ability to master higher-level skills later on**. If you don’t know your scales, you won’t be able to play a song. And if you don’t practice that song, you won’t be able to play your part during a performance.

Translated to real estate sales, this same concept applies. If you don’t know basic scripts, you won’t be able to reach your leads. And if you can’t reach any leads, you won’t make any sales.

Of course, **mastering these basic skills doesn’t come instantly**. It takes practice, which is the core of today’s message.

And it’s absolutely fine to start small. When you start practicing scripts, the best way to nail down this basic skill is by first practicing alone, and then by doing so in front of more experienced agents in your professional circle. Then, of course, you need to try it out on some real potential clients. Starting out, you should be using that script to have at least four conversations with leads five days a week.

Over time, things will get easier—but that doesn’t mean you should stop practicing. **Even industry masters still practice the basics every day**.

There’s no quick fix to mastering these skills, but you’ll be glad you took the time to work on them when you see what they can do for your career.
