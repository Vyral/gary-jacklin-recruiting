This is your wake-up call about reaching your 2021 business goals.

I’m apologizing ahead of time because I’m going to give you a kick in the teeth you may need. Today I’m discussing your 2021 goals.

You need to take a look at your main goal and ask yourself, “Am I on track to achieve my goal by the end of the year?” You only have about four months left to achieve your goal, so if you’re not on track to reach it, you aren’t spending enough time in the four dollar-producing activities of listing, selling, negotiating, and prospecting. If you’re currently thinking to yourself, “I do this full time, but it’s such a wacky market!” I have a couple of questions you should ask yourself.

Are you uploading, downloading, and creating? You’re not going to make money doing those things because they’re not dollar-productive activities. How much time are you spending with buyers? You should be focusing on growing your career, which means working with listings and sellers.

“You only have about four months left to achieve your goal.”

You need voice to voice to get a face to face appointment. You want to target sellers because on average, one buyer will take up 32 hours of your time, while a seller will only take up eight. We’ve discussed only working with qualified buyers in the past, and they’re those who also have a home to sell. If you’re focused on speaking with sellers every day, the majority of them will also buy a home.

My goal today was to rattle your cage, get you back on track, and help you hit your goal. If you’re not on track to reach your goal by the end of 2021, we need to talk.

Download this free document that will help you develop a business plan and stay on track. Then call, text, or email me. I’d be glad to share what we do here at RE/MAX Action and how you can get results.

These three fundamentals can help you find success in your real estate business.

There are three fundamentals that can help guarantee your success as a real estate agent. If you follow and build upon these foundations, you can ensure that your business thrives. Here’s what you need to do:

1. Build it first: Anything that is built must first be envisioned, but you have to come up with a plan to make it happen. You need to have a written business plan that will help you accomplish your goals.

2. Be intentional: Sticking to the plan means adhering to a schedule. You need to block out time to get things done, and you need to be fully present in your activities. You have your family life and your spiritual life, and now you need your business life. When you’re working, remove distractions and focus on growing your business.

3. Focus on the major things: In sales, you can’t get bogged down in minor processes—you need to put your energy into the things that truly matter. It can be easy to “prepare to prepare” for minor things like updating databases or uploading Facebook posts. The major things come from instances where you are “in the presence of” clients, prospects, and others who make you revenue. Look at your schedule, see where you spend your time, and make sure you’re using the majority of it in the presence of clients. Delegate the minor things to others.

If you’d like to go deeper into these concepts, or if you’d like to learn more about growing your business, feel free to reach out to me. If you’re looking for a place to start, click here for a free download. I look forward to helping you soon.

        <title>3 Tips for Agents With Limited Time or Money</title>

        <description>



 

Here are my tips on dealing with limited time and money.

There’s no denying it: Every real estate agent out there struggles with two major things. Either they don’t have enough money or they don’t have enough time. Here are some practical steps to address both.

1. Focusing on listings instead of buyers will save you time. If you’re focused on buyers, you’re spending on average at least 32 hours per buyer. If you focus on listings, you’re doing four times as much within the same amount of time. It takes an average of eight hours to work with a typical seller.

2. Only work with qualified buyers and sellers. When I go on a listing appointment, the best listing I could have is a seller that wants to buy. That’s not to say that we don’t have our challenges. I’ve talked in the past about what we can do to help that seller deal with the fear of not finding the right house.

3. Do what others are unwilling to do. There’s a reason why 10% of the agents do 90% of the business. If you’re not where you want to be production-wise or you’re spending too much time doing the number of transactions that you’re doing, then you need to be willing to do what the others aren’t willing to do and be proactive. Go back to the fundamentals, have a conversation face-to-face, and go on listing appointments. Send out about 15 to 20 simple tests to your database every day. Ask them if they know what’s going on in the market and if they’re at all curious as to what their home’s value is.

“Your focus should always be on listings.”

Go back to your past clients and text them, ask if they’re aware of what their property value is right now, then do a market analysis and get in front of them. This opens the conversation, but we’re always focused on the listing. When we’re focused on their listing, their fear is going to be that they can’t find a home. However, since you’re being proactive and doing what others won’t do, which is door-knocking and cold calling, you can find a home for them. You’ll be finding other listings in the meantime. Your focus should always be on listings. Here is a free download with some slides to help you on your listing appointment and with buyers to show them why now is the very best time to buy and sell.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email, call, or text me. If you’d like a written business plan on how to move forward and really implement these strategies, I’d be happy to meet with you.

        <description>



 

Today I’m sharing advice on how you can help overcome a client’s selling fears.

Today I’m talking about how to overcome the No. 1 objection that sellers have about listing their homes right now. Sellers are saying, “I’m not going to list my house because I’m afraid I won’t find a home to purchase.” So how do we overcome their fear of homelessness?

1. Discuss everything thoroughly with the client. We go into this in a very methodical way. We have our plan and share that with the client so they can have confidence in us that by implementing all of these strategies as part of our marketing plan, we’ll find them a home.

2. Organize a rent-back agreement. Possession is different than closing, so if we buy some time by delaying the closing, it can be risky. I’d rather work with possession. In multiple-offer situations, work with the offer that will do an extended possession where the seller can rent back at the buyer’s price.

“When you’re on that listing appointment, do what the other agents are unwilling to do.”

3. Leverage your time to find listings for your clients. When sellers won’t list because they can’t find a home to buy, that’s the perfect opportunity for the specific buyer dialogue. That’s strategy! If you are unaware of what that is, click here to download the specific buyer script. Now we need to go out to the marketplace the seller told you they like. Now you’re leveraging your time to find the perfect home for that particular seller.

In the meantime, you’re going to find other listings and other people that are moving. That’s how you fill your pipeline listings in the future. By doing this, you will also find a home for another client. This becomes part of your arsenal of marketing plans when you’re working with the seller. When you’re on that listing appointment, do what the other agents are unwilling to do. Make phone calls and knock on doors to find listings for your particular buyer.

If you would like more specifics on exactly how to go about doing that, call, text, or email me. I’d be happy to answer any questions for you. Have a great day.

These are the five main reasons why people choose to sell their homes.

There are many reasons why homeowners don’t want to sell their homes, but there are five specific reasons why most of them do want to sell:


  Their home no longer meets their needs.
  They want to make a profit in the current market.
  They want a smaller house with less work.
  They want to live closer to friends and family.
  They want different features and amenities.


To know what these sellers are thinking, you need to be their trusted advisor. You have a gold mine in your phone, but are you mining it? Are you calling the people in your database? If you’re not, start now.

Make sure you at least touch base with them, because if they’re thinking about moving, they’re thinking about one of the five items in the list I mentioned above. Understand, ask questions, and try to discover where they’re at as a homeowner. Most agents will not do that simple task.

“You have a gold mine in your phone, but are you mining it?”

Stay tuned for my next video where I’ll cover the biggest objections from home sellers, aka “What’s holding them back?”

If you have any questions for me about prospecting, scripts, or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>



 

Here’s a look into the three biggest issues real estate agents face daily.

When it comes to the biggest challenges facing agents today, there are three that come to mind right away. I’m going to go through each of them and show you how to overcome them:

1. Time. We all have the same 24 hours in the day, but why are some of us more productive than others? One of the big factors is learning to say “no.” It’s not that you don’t want to help somebody out, but it can often get you off track. If it’s not going to interrupt your focus, by all means, help. However, sometimes you just need to say, “I’d love to, but I can’t right now.” 

Keeping your focus is also important. Prioritize specific activities for specific periods of the day. You should be spending two hours prospecting every day and pre-scheduling your appointments. The most dollar-productive times are evenings and weekends. Prioritize them in this order: Listings → buyer appointments → prospecting time. 

2. Money. This is critical to our business and success. You are the CEO of your business as a real estate agent. Are you holding your money accountable? You need to know why you’re paying for something, what you’re getting back from the money you are spending, and whether or not you truly need to purchase something based on your budget. Everyone is going to try to sell you the “easy” button, but it doesn’t exist.

“It’s important to leverage the admin staff on your team.”

3. People. You have a team whether you realize it or not. It might just be your broker. You need leadership to help you sustain and grow your business. Do you have a mentor you trust? A coach that holds you accountable? 

You also want to have access to training to master the basic skills so you can become a more profitable agent. Your admin staff is important as well. Have you really leveraged this staff? If you’re doing it all yourself, you’re just an unpaid secretary.

These questions barely scratch the surface of what you need to be a successful real estate agent. At RE/MAX Action, we’re focused on you working smarter, not harder. I have a step-by-step plan that I’d love to share with you; just reach out to me, and I’ll send you a copy.

If you have any other questions for me about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>



 

These are the steps you need to follow to make sure you hire a great assistant.

In a previous post, I talked about how to navigate the process of hiring an assistant. Afterward, I had a lot of people reaching out to me and asking for more information about this process, so I thought it’d be helpful to provide an overview of the three key steps to follow. Here’s what you should do when hiring an assistant for your real estate business:

1. Understand which vital activities are most relevant. There are vital tasks that must be done in a real estate business, but not all of them are relevant to you as an agent. You want to be focused on the dollar-productive activities and leave the behind-the-scenes work to your assistant.

2. Know the strengths and weaknesses of the position. After you know what your assistant will focus on, you need to figure out what strengths they’ll need to have. Will your assistant be doing a lot of paperwork, for example? In that case, you want someone who’s very detail-oriented.

3. Know how their characteristics align with the position. A DiSC assessment can be incredibly helpful when going through potential candidates and making sure their strengths align with what you’re looking for. For example, you may want someone who’s more cautious or someone who’s very compassionate. The DiSC assessment can help you discover these traits in candidates before choosing who to hire.

I’d be happy to share the resources I use with you. If you have any questions about hiring an assistant or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

There are some simple ways to organize multiple offers successfully.

When you’re dealing with different listings that have multiple offers, things can quickly get out of control and lead to a lot of confusion. That’s why it’s important to keep everything organized by including three key things in your multiple offer summary worksheet. 

First, you obviously want to include the contact information for the listing, such as the address, seller’s name, etc. Next, you want to list all of the information regarding the contract—using a spreadsheet can help out a lot with this. This includes: 


  The names of buyers
  Their agents
  The offering price
  Seller credits
  Purchase price
  Escalation clauses
  Earnest money
  Down payment percentages
  Types of loans
  Lenders
  Closing dates
  Inspections
  Concessions
  Additional comments and information


You should also create a columned list of all the offers made, as well as their terms. While this is great for personal reference, it’s also something you can share with your sellers when you’re discussing offers. It helps further when coming up with counter offers, as there’s far more to consider than just the price. You’ll want to be able to easily look at the terms, how much they’re putting down, and other information mentioned in the list above.

If you take the time to organize your listings in these ways, you’ll find the process of managing multiple offers becomes much, much easier. If you have any questions or would like more information, always feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>



Here&rsquo;s how to make your first hiring decision a good one.

If you want to grow your production and get to the next level, hiring an assistant is a must. As I’ve touched on in previous videos, it’s vital that agents stay focused on those core dollar-productive activities. Everything that’s not vital to a transaction is still relevant, but it should be handled by someone else that you can trust. What’s the process that drives your business forward? What do you need to know, do, and have to hire the right person and train them adequately on that process?

Many agents think that hiring someone just because they’ve been in real estate before is a good call. Truth be told, experience moving through the revolving door of real estate is no reason to hire someone.

I’ve put together a free, downloadable guide designed to help you hire the ideal assistant. Just give me a call, text, or email and I’ll get that right out to you. I’d also be more than happy to answer any other questions on how to leverage your business in a very effective and efficient way. Let’s have a conversation soon; today is a perfect time to start breaking through to that next level!

These four steps will help you get more listings.

There’s an adage in the real estate business: If you’re not busy, get yourself busy. In other words, if you don’t have enough listings, then you need to get out there and find them. Today I’ll share the four steps it takes to get more listings quickly:

1. Use your phone’s contact records. When was the last time you stopped playing with your CRM and actually called these contacts? Agents often have anywhere from 800 to 3,000 contacts on their phones.  You can download these contacts to your desktop and call them from there.

2. Call to check in and see what’s happening. Many people are frustrated right now due to being constricted to their homes, and they want to move. Our low inventory is often what holds them back from selling. If there aren’t enough listings, you need to get out there and find them. Reach out to me for a script you can use to find listings for sellers who will need to buy once they’ve listed their homes. You can use it to create a personal listing network of those people who are willing to show their homes to specific buyers.

“Once you’ve made 50 to 60 calls, I bet you’ll be very busy listing and selling homes.”

3. Start filling your pipeline. Fill your pipeline with your inventory of people who may move when they find something to buy first. This will give you listings. In the meantime, it will also help you find other potential sellers who may want to move.

4. Just do it. Put these strategies into action. Once you’ve made 50 to 60 calls, I bet you’ll be very busy listing and selling homes.

If you have any questions or would like more information about our specific buyer strategy, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.

        <description>



I&rsquo;m sharing three tips for agents struggling in the current market.

Today’s discussion may be a little difficult to hear, but if you’re not making tons of commission dollars in the current market, you’re doing something wrong. I can pinpoint what those mistakes may be, so here are the three things you need to know to do well as a real estate agent right now:

1. Scheduling a face-to-face meeting is essential. This business is all about using voice to voice to get face to face. No real estate can be transacted without a meeting. Sure, we can do many things virtually, but the vast majority of transactions will require a face-to-face meeting. That means you need to schedule an appointment, which sounds simple, but it’s very challenging for many agents. So how do you do it? Well…

2. Reach out to your database. Those of you who have been calling your database are the ones rocking it these days. If you haven’t been, start calling the people in your database. Make a list of people to call, and make five calls a day.

3. Your message should start with the state of the market. Letting them know what’s happening in the market is your foot in the door. You know appreciation has increased, the average time on the market has been slashed, and many people are moving for a long list of reasons. Be prepared before you call.

“Those of you who have been calling your database are the ones rocking it these days.”

Here at RE/MAX Action, one of the best tools we have is the buyer script. It’s a concept, it doesn’t have to be followed word for word. Here’s the reality: You need to be proactive, make phone calls, talk to people, and have a reason why you’re calling so you can continue to help people move. If you do this, you’ll get more business.

If you have any questions or would like our buyer script, call, text, or email me, and I’ll send it to you. Let’s start rocking it!

        <description>



There are three types of activities every real estate agent should know.

With each passing day, more tasks seem to require your attention in the real estate business, but how do you prioritize them all? The first step in creating a clear path to success in the industry is to separate your daily tasks into three essential categories: vital activities, relevant activities, and irrelevant activities. Here’s what I mean:

1. Vital activities. These are the tasks that you must do every day. We call them the dollar-productive activities. They directly impact your business and the income you generate.

2. Relevant activities. Whether you’ve taken a listing with a seller or are working with a buyer, these are the activities that you must delegate; they still need to get done, but they’re not dollar productive.

3. Irrelevant activities. These are the things that must be ignored. Despite all my years in real estate, it still amazes me how many agents who aren’t generating the income they want spend all of their time in this business doing tasks that are frankly unnecessary. Check your to-do list; have you been wasting time?

Here at RE/MAX Action, we structure our business around the 47 vital listing activities and the 47 vital buyer activities. We’ve compiled these activities into a resource booklet, and it’s a gold mine of information—a helpful tool to give you direction on what, exactly, you need to be doing with your time in every circumstance. This resource is the product of not only my experience but the experiences of thousands of agents who have collectively navigated thousands of transactions.

“We structure our business around the 47 vital listing activities and the 47 vital buyer activities.”

I’d be happy to share this document with you so you can get a sense of how we stay laser-focused here at RE/MAX Action. Just reach out via the links on our website, or give me a call, text, or email, and I’ll get it out to you right away.

If you have questions about this or any other real estate topic, I’d love to hear about those, too. As always, go list and sell a house, my friend!

These three assets will help you improve your lead conversion.

Lead generation is not lead conversion. I’m sure you already know that, but it bears repeating because people often forget. Here are the three things you must have in order to convert leads to cash:

1. Understand that the vast majority of internet leads are just leads. They’re not business… yet. However, today’s leads are more valuable than the leads of days past because we get them into our system earlier.

2. A follow-up system. This will automate the things that are most important to get a lead into the conversion process. We give them what they want, not what we want them to want. Over time, giving them what they want will fill our pipeline up with good leads of all shapes and sizes. What do they want? Helpful content and information we can share to help educate them about the market and real estate in general.

3. A robust CRM. This will take all of your leads, put them in one place, and help you engage with them regularly. Plugging your leads into a system helps keep leads organized and gives you a much higher chance of conversion.

If you don’t have these three things in place, you’re going to continue to struggle converting leads. If you want to learn more or just have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

If you&rsquo;re having trouble reaching your goals, follow these four steps.

We’ve all heard the term “goal setting” before. If you’ve been setting goals and not attaining them, though, there are four key steps you need to remember to get back on track:

1. You have to actually set your goal. In other words, you need a clear understanding of what you want. You can put that into context and apply it to your personal, spiritual, or business life, but the business aspect is what funds the other two parts of your life. As big as your goals might be, you have to boil them down to their basic essence, know why they’re your goals and not someone else’s, and understand what sacrifices you’re willing to make to reach the end point. It always boils down to a business goal, or how you will fund your other main goals.

2. You have to put that goal into action. When you focus on the financial goal you need to reach your bigger goals, you need a written plan. If you’re taking a vacation to Las Vegas, you naturally have to know how to get there, and the same logic applies to your goal. Once you’ve gone deep on that, you can boil it down to simple activities over time—day after day, week after week, month after month—that lead to your yearly goal. Your written plan should include your budget, where your business comes from, and where your best return on investment is outside of advertising and marketing. Specifically, I mean time: What time are you spending doing these activities? Are you getting results? Once you know the answers to these questions, it’s onto the next step.

3. Find a coach to help you follow your action plan. Once you have a written action plan, you need a coach—someone who will hold you accountable to your own plan. You’ve already analyzed and determined your plan, so who’ll check in and actually press you on your progress? Very few of us can hold ourselves accountable, which is why coaches are critical.

4. Make a business plan template tailored to you. How do you take everything we’ve talked about so far and synthesize it into a document that helps you think about what you want?

“Your written plan should include your budget, where your business comes from, and where your best return on investment is outside of advertising and marketing.”

If you already have something in place, that’s awesome! Stick with it; maybe all you need is someone to hold you accountable. If you don’t have a working template to organize your activities, get in touch with me and I’d be happy to provide you one.

As always, if there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me as well. I look forward to speaking with you.

        <description>



Here are the three things every agent needs to take their business further.

No matter what level you’ve attained in your real estate career, there will always be a level higher waiting for you. If you’re serious about leveling up, consider the value and true definition of each of these three things:

1. Training. You may roll your eyes as you read that word and think, “Look, I’m not new to this industry, I don’t need training.” However, if that’s your first thought, then you’ve missed the point already; in real estate (as in most professions), the training never stops. I’m learning and getting trained on new things all of the time, and you should be too. Every professional sports team holds a training camp before the season starts.

The main concepts of how we make money in real estate will never change, but we have to be continually trained on new technologies that will help us do those core dollar-producing activities at a more efficient and effective level.

“A mentor is someone who takes a higher level look at your business.”

2. Coaching. You have to have a coach, but exactly who qualifies as one? Let’s visit the sports team analogy: The coach doesn’t train the team on the basics or even position-specific skills—they help keep each player accountable to the plays they’ve trained on. Do you have an accountability coach who’s keeping you on track to reach that next level?

3. Mentoring. A mentor is someone who takes a higher level look at your business and helps you on a more consultative basis. They’ll look at your goals and methodology and do what’s called a gap analysis—an unbiased search for any gaps that may exist between the place that you claim you want to reach and the plans you’ve implemented to reach it. Ideally, your mentor should have experience not just in listing and selling but in running a team at a very high level. They should have already attained the level you’re seeking to attain.

Here at RE/MAX Action, we have a step-by-step guide for training, coaching, and mentoring, so don’t hesitate to reach out by phone or email if you want to know about that. I’m always ready to help in any way I can!

        <description>

Here are my three best tips for converting leads into closed transactions.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

These are my three key tips to convert suspects (aka leads) into closed transactions:

1. Use a calendar. Hopefully, a suspect has provided you an email and a phone number, and you usually contact them right away. However, you may forget to reach out again in the future. So, as soon as you get their information, write it down in your calendar and schedule a time to call or text them again. If you don’t have their number, at the very least, send them a personal email.

2. Provide new listings and market surveys. If they’re a buyer lead, provide them with the newest listings at a rate of one per week—any more than this may overwhelm them and push them away. If they’re a seller suspect (or they’re a buyer but you’re unsure if they’re also a seller), provide them with an area market survey. Particularly if you know a specific town or area they’re looking in, send them that survey, which is available through your MLS. These surveys will include what homes are selling for, what has come on and off the market, and anything else relevant to that market.

“Learn to use the technology available to you.”

3. Use connectMLS. We’re a mobile society; we live on our phones. This is one of the most valuable tools you can use because it automates your systems and obtains relative housing information. It can be customized to fit your needs.

Extra tip: Learn to use the technology available to you, as it’s designed to keep you from getting bogged down in all the tiny details. Some of you may feel you don’t want to use more technology, but it’s easy, and you’re already using your phone all day anyway. Find the systems that work for you, have the most to offer, and are affordable. I can help you find these if you’re interested, and I’ll also share which ones we’re using on our team.

If you want more information or have any questions about today’s topic, call, text, or email me. I’m happy to share my experience and advice with you.

        <description>

These are the apps every agent needs.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

Here are the four apps you must have as a real estate agent:

1. ShowingTime. Being a busy agent servicing your clients also means managing their showings. If you download this app, you’ll be using it every day, and I highly recommend using it to its full potential.

2. SentriLock. This app makes it easier to access and show properties because the documentation is provided for you.

3. A buyer cost analysis app and seller net analysis app. Many title companies offer a free app, and I use the app provided by Chicago Title. It’s simple, robust, and you can always upgrade it. It’s set up to serve the Chicago metro area, and it’s a powerful tool to help close a buyer when they’re walking through a home.

4. An app for filing legal paperwork. This is a great way to access all of your pending transactions and the accompanying legal paperwork. It’s more or less a filing system for your contracts, forms, listing sheets, and social media material. If you need help managing this type of app, give me a call and I’d be happy to tell you what we at RE/MAX Action use. It’s a free tool that we control at the office level, so everything is provided for you—no uploading or downloading necessary.

If you’d like to know more about tools that can make you more productive as an agent, or if you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s how you should handle multiple-offer situations.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

A lot of agents are struggling with competing against multiple offers right now. Here are three ways that you can come out on top:

1. Build rapport. It’s critical in this relationship-based business to have a good rapport with other agents, coworkers, and everyone else in the industry. We’re benevolent adversaries. We represent different sides of the transaction, but we all have the same goal in the end. From the very start, be courteous, professional, and communicative.

“You aren’t trying to drive your client’s price up, you’re just looking out for their best interests.”

2. Find out what the seller wants. Call their agent and use the rapport you’ve built to talk to them about what the seller is looking for in an offer before you even write it. Then you can tailor your offer to give you a much better chance of being accepted.

3. Have the proper dialogue down. Part of what you need to have is the right words. The latter approach works well. Once you know the price they’re looking for, say something like this: “If I came back to you tomorrow and said they accepted another offer for $1,000 more, could you live with that? See what their reaction and response is. You’re not trying to drive them up in price, you’re just looking out for their best interests in a competitive market.

If you have questions for me about how the agents on our team are winning in this market or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

If your leads aren&rsquo;t converting enough, these three tips can help.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

Why aren’t more of your leads converting? I’m sharing three ways to ensure you get more leads. It all comes down to what you need to know, need to do, and need to have:

1. What you need to know: Use a database to organize your leads. You need to know who your leads are and have a place to put them. In case you’re unfamiliar with it, a database is where all client information is kept in a secure place; you need to have it somewhere.

2. What you need to do: Contact your database at least once a week. Keep them up to date, whether it’s with a phone call, text, or email with helpful content.

3. What you need to have: Technology that gives them what they want. Everyone lives somewhere, which means they are either going to buy a home or already own one and will eventually need to sell. So provide information that they have in common. If they own a home, send them data on home values in their area—there are automated ways to do that. Your MLS likely has that, which can connect your database to what they need.

If they’re looking to buy, send what they might be looking for. Again, look to your MLS. Here at RE/MAX Action, we’ve combined the MLS and our database into one powerful tool.

“It all comes down to what you need to know, do, and have.”

If you’re interested in how we do these three things or what technology we use, call, email, or text me. I would love to help you convert more leads.

        <description>

Today I&rsquo;ll talk about five attributes your CRM must have to stay relevant.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

If you want to stay relevant to buyers and sellers in today’s market, the CRM you use will need to have five capabilities:

1. MLS integration. What do most buyers and sellers want? What’s the hot-button item right now? What’s a particular house worth after COVID? By integrating your CRM with the MLS, you can send your clients the information they need.

2. Social media integration and authentication. When you enter a lead, does your CRM go out and find all the social media attached to the client’s contact information? It’s critical that you’re able to connect via social media. Facebook, Instagram, Google Pay-per-Clicks, etc. all need to be integrated into your CRM.

3. Video integration. The biggest impact you can have is with face-to-face interaction, so make sure your CRM integrates video.

“We arm our agents with a cutting-edge CRM that utilizes all these features.”

4. Artificial intelligence. If someone inquires about one of your ads, you know what price range, area, and style of home they’re interested in, so instead of going to your MLS and putting in a saved search, have a robust CRM that will actually set that up for you.

5. Mass texting, emailing, and voicemail capacity. Communication is the key to converting leads. Once we have them, we need to be able to text and email them, as well as leave voicemail messages. A system that reminds you to do that is incredibly powerful and helps you to grow your relationship with those leads from suspect to prospect to active to a transaction. This can add tens of thousands of dollars to your yearly commission income.

At RE/MAX Action, we arm our agents with a cutting-edge CRM that utilizes all the features I’ve just laid out for you. If you’d like to know more about this CRM or have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

        <description>

These three things will help you generate 50 to 100 new leads per month.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

In our business, leads are everything. If you’re looking to increase the number of leads you get each month, try the following three tips:

1. Strategize where and how to advertise. We’ve found that Facebook is an incredible resource, but it’s also a matter of how you use it. Are you doing targeted ads? Are you retargeting your ads? Are you including video? In today’s market, you absolutely should implement video into your strategy.

2. Budget for six months of advertising. A good strategy is great, but if you have no budget, it won’t do you any good. Take a step back and look at what you can afford with a six-month commitment. I’d suggest at least $100 per month. At RE/MAX Action, we know our numbers; buyer leads are just under $2 apiece. 

3. Use the right tools. To not only capture those leads, but to also convert them into actual transactions, you need a robust CRM with automated integration. That will help you engage those leads to work with you. RE/MAX actually provides this tool, which means tens of thousands of commission dollars for our agents.

If you don’t have a CRM or need help finding the right one that will work for you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. The right tool for you is out there. Hope to hear from you soon!

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s a simple, powerful listing strategy for your day-to-day grind.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

One of the biggest challenges those in our profession face right now is getting listings. Here are three surefire ways to do it, regardless of the circumstances:

1. Set a daily goal to focus on and keep you motivated. Keep it simple; when you wake up to face the day, your goal should be to find a listing that’s not already on the market and get it on the market. I’m not talking about prospecting or getting leads—those are suspects whose incubation period can be up to 13 months. Where do we get the ‘now’ business? You know the answer: The people who know, like, and trust you.

2. Make a daily goal for the number of conversations you need to have. We know to calculate the weekly number by looking at the following: listings sold per listings taken per listing appointments scheduled per conversations had. That weekly number, of course, then breaks down into a daily number.

3. Use an app to identify potential business opportunities and track your daily goals. Technology doesn’t have to be confusing or hard to work. There are apps out there that make our lives easier via artificial intelligence—a big word that basically means everything we do online gets tracked and stored as data, and this data can be used for many things. The right apps can use data points from our database (i.e., our phone, email, and social media contacts) to give us a clue as to who’s most likely thinking about moving soon. Keeping track of your conversations via the app only takes five to 15 minutes a day, and gives you a better understanding of potential seller sentiments within your database.

Here at RE/MAX Action, we provide agents with an app that can get the job done. Our agents can be more effective in less time and generate more of the ‘now’ business they seek.

“Technology doesn’t have to be confusing or hard to work.”

If you’d like to know the specific app that we have and how exactly we use it, just call, email, or text me anytime and I’d be more than happy to get you that information. I look forward to talking to you!

Doing more business starts with setting the right expectations.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

Conflict only exists where expectations differ. Part of what you need when prospecting for clients is a discussion regarding roles and expectations. You’ll also need a signed agreement from the seller, as well as a written roles and expectations tool to use. Here’s how each of them should go.

First, you should have a sit down with your seller about the roles and expectations for both of you. We need to be on the same page to have a successful, win-win sale. With those expectations clearly set, it’s now time to make an agreement.

“This tool is critical for a smooth transaction.”

After we make that agreement in principle, it’s time to put it in writing. It’s not a bad idea to have it be part of your marketing plan. You can spell out what kind of communication your client can expect from you each week regarding showing feedback, marketing results, etc. It also lays out your expectations of the seller, including keeping their home clean and ready for showings. This tool is critical.

If you need help putting a plan together for your sellers, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d love to give you a copy of ours and answer any questions you may have. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about owning your listing conversations.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

 

Recently, I was talking with one of our agents, and she relayed her amazement at the ease with which she was able to have an impactful listing conversation and truly set herself apart from the competition. The seller even complimented her on her approach, which, by design, incorporated these three steps:

1. Understand the concept and idea behind the listing conversation. Stop inviting sellers to a listing presentation. Instead, invite them to a value-added, highly effective listing conversation. In other words, we’re not desperate for listings, and we’re not going to pressure the seller in any way; we’re meeting with the seller to see if a win-win working relationship can be created.

2. Know the five stages of converting a listing into a listing conversation:


  Handle pre-conversation activities. Think of the right questions, assemble the right tools, confirm the appointment, and prepare the listing agreement.
  Set the tone for the meeting. Establish the boundaries for a win-win relationship.
  The message should be the goals, plans, and strategies. Uncover the needs, prioritize them, and then introduce and review the CMA.
  Address mutual expectations. Many agents leave expectations unspoken, but it’s important that you and the potential listing client gain agreement on what your roles will be in the working relationship through clear communication.
  Handle post-conversation activities. Address any remaining questions, comments, or concerns, then present and explain the listing agreement.


3. Follow a step-by-step guide to implementing and executing the listing conversation. This means adding (conservatively) $25,000 to $60,000 to your bottom line.

If you don’t already have an approach in place to turn your listing presentation into a conversation, call, text, or email us and I’d love to elaborate more on what’s getting us great results. We’re here to help, and we look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

Here are three great ways to take advantage of all the pent-up demand.If you want to get ahold of me, give me a call or send a text!

Since there is so much negativity right now, I’d like to start today’s message on a positive note. Whenever one of my agents gets a new listing, I like to send them a congratulations text. The other day I sent three of these texts to my agents and all three responded that they had received multiple offers and sold the homes already. While we had more listings than that, three brand-new listings sold in a single morning.

There is so much pent-up demand, which means wonderful opportunities. So I’m sharing three ways to take advantage of this pent-up demand in our real estate market—doing all three could add $35,000 to $50,000 to your gross commission income:

1. Update your database and reach out to them. I say this a lot, but it’s crucial. Touch base with those contacts. Don’t let them forget that you’re there for them.

2. Answer their questions. Get back to them with the answers they need. Some of the most common questions are: What’s my home currently worth, is it a good time to buy or sell, and can I sell safely right now? That last question is the most vital.

3. Have a written response about safety measures. Have a document explaining safety measures for buyers and another for sellers. Why is this needed? What’s holding people back right now is fear and anxiety about everything that’s happening in this country. You need to address their doubts practically.

Showing them you have a plan will prove your professionalism and concern for their safety. Safety should always come first. If you or your company doesn’t have these written statements, contact me and I’ll get them to you. We’re having excellent success with them.

“There is so much pent-up demand, which means wonderful opportunities.”

If you have questions about taking advantage of demand or concerning anything else in real estate, please call or email us. We would love to help you in any way we can.

There is currently enormous pent-up demand in the real estate market. I&rsquo;m discussing how to take advantage of it.

Today I’m sharing another positive message: Take advantage of the opportunities. There is colossal pent-up demand in the real estate market. If you’re not busy, get busy. Now more than ever, you need to get on the phone and communicate the positive message that things are moving in real estate. If clients are uncomfortable meeting face-to-face, do a Zoom meeting.

Advice is only good if it&rsquo;s practical and easily applied to one&rsquo;s life. Today I&rsquo;m sharing some tips that I believe anyone can benefit from&mdash;they certainly changed my life.

Dealing with a crisis requires a firm foundation and a resilient outlook. Years ago, some practical advice was passed along to me that truly changed my life. People label me an optimist as if optimism were some sort of trait I was born with, but they fail to realize that optimism is a choice that everyone has to make each day.

Today I’m sharing some of the most impactful tips I’ve accrued throughout my career in the hopes that you’ll find them useful during this difficult period of lockdown. For example, my approach to work was revolutionized by this simple motto: “There are no problems, only challenges and solutions.”

Right now you can take advantage of a bit of a lull to make sure your business is adapted for the future.

During these unprecedented times, we’re finding different ways of doing business. If you haven’t already, now is the time you must start embracing all the technology out there. In the future, this technology won&rsquo;t replace your job, but those who succeed in this business will be the ones who embrace technology.

While we’re all sheltering in place, it’s tougher to get face to face than it usually is. The more comfortable you are with video chatting, however, the more opportunities you will get to be face to face during this time.

If you’d like more information on how to utilize this technology, please reach out. I look forward to sharing with you.

        <description>

Don&rsquo;t take your foot off the gas when it comes to your business. There are plenty of things you can doing right now to see yourself through this period.

I find it helpful to approach these unprecedented times the same way we’d address the last quarter of the year. Think about it: So many agents take that last chunk of the year off, starting around Thanksgiving, and their business comes to a halt. They let the natural market slowdown during the holidays discourage them, but just as I caution those agents to never stop filling their pipelines, I urge agents now to keep reaching out to people. The key, of course, is to not blatantly push anything; we’re just touching base to genuinely ask how folks are doing and if we can be of assistance.

If you’d like to participate in a Zoom session with us, please reach out. We’re happy to help.

        <description>

To organize your database, you can use my five-star system.

Advances in technology have supposedly made us agents more organized and efficient, right? Well, I’ve found that there’s a lot of confusion regarding who to call and when to call them. Of course, I’m referring to your database. Every agent has a database, and hopefully, you have one that’s integrated with the MLS, which is what you want.

The thing is, to keep in touch with these people, we know that the objective is to get voice to voice so you can then get face to face. Whether it’s a listing or buyer appointment, that face-to-face meeting will let you know whether your would-be client is motivated, qualified, and loyal. So how do you prioritize your database? Follow along in the video above as I answer that question in its entirety.

For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of the conversation:

1:34 - Prioritizing your prospecting session through my five-star system2:09 - ⭐: Just keeping in touch 2:30 - ⭐⭐: Calling every week3:32 - ⭐⭐⭐: Setting an appointment4:01 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐: Talking face to face4:31 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Actively working with them5:24 - Where do they go after the deal closes?5:44 - Wrapping up today’s topic

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s how you clean up your database to get more listings.

Any time of year is a great time to get listings. As the old saying goes, “You have to get busy to be busy.” As an agent, though, you need to be proactive and intentional about it.

Every agent out there has at least two or three CRMs with integrated MLS information, and I have a simple process to clean up your database and accomplish three very important objectives:


  Feel comfortable learning and using the CRM you choose.
  Finally gather all of your contacts into one CRM.
  Be prospecting and securing future listings. You’ll also build sales by building trust. To do business with the contacts in your database, they have to know, like, and trust you with their real estate needs.


The process involves a few key steps.

First, call your database. They already know and like you, but now they have to start trusting you with their real estate needs. Call them and get them all into one place. Start with some small talk and ask them if there’s anything you can do for them. Just focus on the call and getting everyone in the same place—not whether they want to buy or sell. Most of them are homeowners who will buy or sell in the future, but don’t worry about that. Right now, you’re just cleaning up your database, having conversations, and finding people who may need something from you.

“When a conversation takes place and the person on the other end of the line asks you a question, that’s your opportunity.”

Once you’ve selected your CRM, you’ll then update the contact information of everyone in it, including their names, phone numbers, email addresses, and mailing addresses.

Next, update them with an automated market value of their homes. If they’re buying, update them on what they might be looking for.

When a conversation takes place and the person on the other end of the line asks you a question, that’s your opportunity. They’ve given you permission to talk about real estate. As you have your conversations, add some notes to their contact information. Most importantly, remember that everyone lives somewhere, so if a person owns their home, send them a monthly valuation of it. The whole objective here is to get them to reach out to you. Also, find out when they plan on moving.

Stay tuned for my upcoming video where I talk about what to do next. In the meantime, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.

The deeper you know your target market, the greater the number of leads you&rsquo;ll generate.

To highlight the importance of knowing your target market, I’ll summarize a recent conversation I had with an agent who didn’t invest in social media because she was targeting a senior-age market.

Basically, she argued that since she was actively involved in a retirement/assisted-living community and garnered plenty of referrals that way, it wasn’t necessary for her to use social media as a part of her business strategy; people 80 years old and up aren’t active on social media.

While I agreed that being involved in a community or organization is always a solid approach to lead generation, I suggested that the real target for her in the senior market was the kids who help their elderly parents make decisions—people around 45 to 60 years old.

“Using Facebook can help you better understand and connect with your real target market.”

That demographic is actually very active on Facebook, so having a presence there creates a huge opportunity. Using this platform can help you better understand and connect with your real target market, and there are even several ways to restructure your targets within Facebook.

If you’d like more information on how best to utilize Facebook or other social media platforms, call, text, or email me. I’d love to discuss this or other real estate topics with you.

        <description>

If you want to set a goal and achieve it, write that goal down.

When a new year begins, it’s always good to look at where you’ve been the previous year and where you’re going this year. It’s called goal-setting.

The most important tip I can share with you when it comes to goal setting is to have something in writing. This way, you can refer back to those goals. I’ve found that people sometimes hesitate writing goals down because that means you actually have to do it.

If you put it in writing that you want to earn $150,000 over the next 12 months, you have to figure out how to get there. To get started, I suggest breaking down your activities. It all boils down to transactions—work backward from there and plan everything in terms of monthly, weekly, and daily goals. Which activities do you need to do so that you accomplish your overarching goal?

“Write your goals down now and make the next 12 months your best months ever.”

Put your goals in writing, but don’t be afraid of them. They’re your goals. It’s your plan. You can change them. It’s no different than when we talk about time blocking and setting schedules. You need to have these things in writing. Just like with your schedule, you can change your goal.

So write your goals down now and make the next 12 months your best months ever.

If you’d like to talk more about goal setting, or if there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.

        <description>

Here are some of my recommendations for apps and platforms to incorporate into your process.

Today’s video is a follow-up to my previous one, in which I made the bold statement that agents who don’t embrace new technology will be left in the dust of ones who do.

That video prompted a lot of questions, and some folks want me to be specific as to what types of tech agents should use. What tools work the best? Let’s once again look at the four focus areas of any successful agent:

1. Lead generation. Get yourself a company website and mobile app if you don’t already have one. Look into other applications such as kvCORE, BoomTown, Commissions Inc., and REDX.

2. Lead conversion. Remember, our goal is to establish voice-to-voice communication so we can get face-to-face interaction. There are so many apps out there that can help you achieve this; ConstantContact is great for emails, and I also use BombBomb a lot.

“Remember, our goal is to establish voice-to-voice communication so we can get face-to-face interaction.”

3. Follow-up. BombBomb is also great for this step, too, but never forget the most important tool here: your telephone. Give your under-contract client meaningful updates.

4. Marketing. This step can be very confusing. If you’re buying leads, well then that’s a whole separate issue for another video. To market to your ‘suspects’ (aka your database), you must be active on Facebook and Instagram.

I’d love the opportunity to meet with you one-on-one and go over any questions you may still have on this topic. Feel free to reach out to me by phone or email anytime.

        <description>

New technology won&rsquo;t replace real estate agents, but those agents who don&rsquo;t embrace tech will be left in the dust of those who do.

Many real estate agents in the industry worry about computers taking away our jobs. Those agents who do not embrace technology will indeed be replaced—not by technology, but rather by those agents that do embrace the technology. Our jobs are completely based on human interaction, and this technology helps us do our jobs more effectively and efficiently.

The true focus of everything we do is getting voice to voice interaction to set appointments and face to face interaction to help get a home sold or purchased. Technology will never be able to do that. It will help the process, but it can’t replace a human expert.

I know a lot of agents are fearful and confused about the increasing technology, and they don’t think they can keep up. Stop saying “I can’t,” and start asking “How can I?”

“People were scared about the internet at first, too.”

The first place to start would be looking at the four areas of your business: lead generation, lead conversion, client follow up, and marketing. That’s it.

In this confusing time, it’s important you embrace technology. People were scared and confused about the internet at first, too.

If you’d like to have a conversation about this topic or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Your database can be a rich source of business if you keep in contact. Here&rsquo;s how we do that at RE/MAX Action.

Today’s topic is a fairly simple concept, but one that can be very effective in today’s age.

Every real estate agent out there knows people. Whether it’s your family and friends, or past clients and other professional contacts; all of those people live somewhere. The majority of them own their own homes. Just by staying in touch with these people, you’ll gain trust in your relationship to hopefully help them with future moves.

For homeowners who are looking to sell, there are really two transactions in one that you can help them with. They need to sell their home first before they buy. Why not provide them with valuable and effective information, such as how much their home is worth? It’s really that simple.

“There’s more than enough business to go around if you know how to find it.”

At RE/MAX Action, we have cutting-edge technology that automates this process to make sure we stay in touch with the people in our databases and that we’re ready to help when someone in your database is ready to buy or sell. There’s more than enough business to go around—you just have to know the right way to aggregate it.

If you have any questions for me about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

How can having five additional conversations with new leads five times a week impact your bottom line?

 

Numbers may not be everyone’s favorite subject, but the truth is that understanding and leveraging numbers is the key to running a successful real estate business. I’ve touched on this before, but let me explain what I mean, again.

If you want to see a higher number of conversions, you need to make a higher number of calls. Thankfully, you don’t have to go to extremes for this idea to work.

Even if you make just five new real estate calls five times a week, the impact on your lead pipeline will be massive. It’s really that simple.

These five conversations five days a week will equal out to 25 new conversations each week. And if you have these 25 new conversations 50 weeks of the year, this means you will have had 1,250 new conversations in just 12 months. It just goes to show how small steps can add up over time. Think about it: What could those 1,250 new conversations do for your bottom line?

“Having just a few more conversations each week will make a huge difference to your bottom line.”

It’s a statistical fact that seven out of every 100 people will buy or sell a home at some point in the year. So, if we divide 1,250 by 100, this gives us 12.5. Then, if we multiply that figure by 7, we’d be left with 87.5. You may be thinking: What does that mean?

In short, it means that of those 1,250 leads you spoke with, 87.5 of them would be in the market to make a deal.  Of course, this math leaves us with an imperfect number, but the point remains: Just five phone calls five times a week could bring you nearly 90 interested leads each year. Even at a conversion rate of just 25%, you’d still get 22 additional transactions out of those 90 leads over the next 12 months. To figure out how this would impact your bottom line, simply take 22 by your average commission. For someone with an average commission of $6,000, these 22 deals would amount to an extra $132,000 in annual income.

The numbers don’t lie. Having just a few more conversations each week will make a huge difference to your bottom line. So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to get dialing.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

If you&rsquo;ve set a goal but aren&rsquo;t anywhere close to reaching it, the GPS strategy can help you.

 

Where are you regarding your goals?

If you’re nowhere near reaching them, you have to decide what you’re going to do about it. The end of the year is coming, and time doesn’t stop for anyone. The way we approach this situation on our team is by using the GPS strategy (goal, plan, strategy). How do you enact this strategy yourself?

First, your goal must be written down. Then, the planning and strategy part will cover how you’re going to get there. After that, you need some input—who have you talked to in the last 30 days, or when you originally set your goal? If you’re not where you want to be, go to that person and discuss your goal with them.

“Ask yourself why you are where you are and how you can go where you want to be.”

Oftentimes, I hear people who haven’t reached their goal say that they need to “lower” their goal because it was unrealistic in the first place. This kind of thing starts with who you initially discuss your goal with. This isn’t to say that it’s too late to reach your goal. It’s never too late, and you could set your yearly goal right now if you wanted to.

Most importantly, though, remember to write your goal down, have a plan and strategy for that goal, and get some input on why you’ve either exceeded your goal or haven’t met it. Ask yourself why you are where you are and how you can go where you want to be.

If you’d like to talk more about establishing your own GPS or you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d be happy to speak with you.

If you want to succeed in real estate sales, you&rsquo;ve got to master the basics. Here&rsquo;s why.

 

Whenever I think about real estate sales, I’m reminded of another one of my life’s passions: music.

How are these things connected?

Well, just like playing an instrument, working as a real estate professional all comes down to a mastery of the basics.

Whether it’s music, sports, or real estate, having a firm grasp of the basics will give you the ability to master higher-level skills later on. If you don’t know your scales, you won’t be able to play a song. And if you don’t practice that song, you won’t be able to play your part during a performance.

Translated to real estate sales, this same concept applies. If you don’t know basic scripts, you won’t be able to reach your leads. And if you can’t reach any leads, you won’t make any sales.

“Over time, things will get easier—but that doesn’t mean you should stop practicing.”

Of course, mastering these basic skills doesn’t come instantly. It takes practice, which is the core of today’s message.

And it’s absolutely fine to start small. When you start practicing scripts, the best way to nail down this basic skill is by first practicing alone, and then by doing so in front of more experienced agents in your professional circle. Then, of course, you need to try it out on some real potential clients. Starting out, you should be using that script to have at least four conversations with leads five days a week.

Over time, things will get easier—but that doesn’t mean you should stop practicing. Even industry masters still practice the basics every day.

There’s no quick fix to mastering these skills, but you’ll be glad you took the time to work on them when you see what they can do for your career.

If you aren&rsquo;t making as much money as you&rsquo;d like to be, follow this simple strategy.

 

If you want to make more money in your career, there are several steps you’ll need to take. Of all of these steps, though, the most critical is to have a plan.

Trying to reach a goal without having a plan for doing so is about as effective as making a cake without any ingredients. That is to say, it’s just not possible. This goal can be as simple as having four new real estate conversations, five days a week every week for the next 12 months. Doing this will all but guarantee that you earn an extra $60,000 in revenue in the year ahead. And if you want to earn more than that, your plan will, of course, need to reflect that.

You may be wondering where I came up with these figures. Simply put, they come from real-world examples that have been pulled from the experiences of thousands of agents. The studies don’t lie—the more dials you make, the more conversations you have. The more conversations you have, the more appointments you get. The more appointments you get, the more listings you get. And, of course, the more listings you get, the more deals you’ll close. It all comes back to your bottom line.

“Implementing the simple strategy I’ve described today can make all the difference.”

The question you must ask yourself is this: Are you where you want to be financially? If not, then implementing the simple strategy I’ve described today can make all the difference.

        <description>

Today marks the first part of a four-series in which I&rsquo;ll discuss tips to help with lead generation, conversion, follow-up, and marketing. We&rsquo;ll begin with lead generation.

 

Oftentimes, all we get from a potential lead is a simple email. At that stage, they’re not yet even a lead, but rather just a suspect. In order for them to actually become a lead, you need to register them in your database—ask them for a name, phone number, and email address. In the age of the internet, why do you need their phone number? Well, nowadays, everyone has a cell phone, meaning you’ll be able to reach them all day any day.

Many agents hesitate to do this, thinking that their clients hate to register. If that’s the case, then those people aren’t even suspects, and I wouldn’t even have the time to deal with them. I only want to work with the ones who will give me their email address and, better, ones who won’t prompt me to spend my resources for nothing. My job is to find actual prospects with whom I can communicate and schedule a one-on-one appointment to then help them buy or sell a home.

“Your suspects can qualify themselves at a deeper level when you ask them to register in your database.”

The real point today is that your suspects can qualify themselves at a deeper level when you ask them to register in your database. If you don’t do that, then I don’t know what you’re looking for.

If you’d like more information about the tools and techniques we use here at RE/MAX Action, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love the opportunity to go a little deeper into this topic with you.

Shifting your mindset from &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; to &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; will put you on a path to greater success in your business. Keep reading to find out how it&rsquo;s done.

 

I’m sure you’ve heard all about the importance of your mindset in this business from other trainers and speakers. I’ve been thinking about this myself lately, so today I’d like to illuminate one of the greatest “mind shifts” that I’ve put into practice in my life and that I’ve stressed to my agents as well.

It’s a concept that many thought leaders have spoken about—the great motivational speaker and sales trainer Jim Rohn and Robert Kiyosaki in his book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” being a few examples.

To be successful in this business, a mind shift must unavoidably take place, and that means moving away from the mental barrier of “I can’t” and toward this question: “How can I?” That’s the mind shift I’m referring to. Therein lies the difference between the few who do so much and the many who do so little.

It sounds simple, but it’s much easier said than done and no one can do it for you. Ultimately, you’re in charge of your own mindset. It’s important to have an awareness of your own self-talk and to realize you’re the one thinking you can’t.

“The bottom line is abandoning “I can’t” and embracing “How can I?” is simple to say, but takes meaningful action to implement.”

One day at a time, take a long, hard look at your goals and start asking, “How can I?” If you want to do 100 deals in a year, understand that there’s someone producing at that level. And if it’s 50, someone’s doing that too. That level of success isn’t the fruit of luck. It’s the fruit of hard work.

The bottom line is abandoning “I can’t” and embracing “How can I?” is simple to say, but takes meaningful action to implement. Start implementing this mind shift in your daily life, and you’ll see positive change.

If you have any questions about shifting your mind, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to talk with you one on one and in greater detail. I’m here to help in any way I can!

What does good communication with your database look like? Let&rsquo;s discuss.

 

In our last message, we spoke about when you should reach out to your database. This time, we’re going to cover what content you should offer and, really, why.

In short, the reason real estate professionals stay in touch with our database is to build and maintain relationships, because these relationships translate into business. As for what kind of content or communication you bring them, the most important thing is that you’re providing value.

Offering this value establishes a sense of trust. It also cements you as a reliable, knowledgeable expert in your field. To give you an example, just a couple of days ago I spoke to my friend Paul about his recent move. Paul isn’t a client—he’s someone I film webinars with. Nevertheless, when he was telling me about his real estate situation, I offered to send him occasional updates on how the market is doing in his area.

“The reason real estate professionals stay in touch with our database is to build and maintain relationships.”

This is a perfect example of what kind of communication you can have with your database. It really can be that simple.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Your database can be a huge source of business and referrals if you nurture it properly. Here&rsquo;s what I recommend.

 

I’ve got two numbers for you: 24 and ½. What does this mean? Well, if you take the number 24 and cut it in half, you have 12. If you cut that in half, you have 6. If you cut that in half, you have 3. What I’m really talking about here with these numbers is how often you should contact your database. It’s a common topic of discussion amongst agents and a question I’m asked all the time.

In your database, remember that your main goal is growing or maintaining relationships. It’s always important to think about what everyone in your database would like and what adds value to them. Housing and other real estate information is something that will always have value to someone in your database.

“It’s always important to think about what information will add value to your relationships.”

So, how do these numbers fit in? Well, first, you should mail or email them twice a month, which equals 24 times per year. 12 is the number of times you should call or text each person throughout the year. 6 is a reminder to call them at least six times per year, then finally the 3 means to do something else for your entire database three times per year. Put all these together, and you have the right tools to nurture and strengthen your database.

If you have any questions for us or want to learn a little bit more about how we use these numbers and touches to our advantage, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

If you want to become a top-producing real estate agent, you must learn to be intentional. Today I&rsquo;ll share what this means and why it&rsquo;s important.

 

You’ve probably heard of the 80/20 rule as it relates to our industry. If you’re unfamiliar with this concept, it basically states that 80% of agents in this business only handle 20% of all deals. The truth is that only a small portion of agents are responsible for the majority of transactions. But why is this the case?

It’s actually quite simple: Most agents aren’t as proactive as they should be. The key to being a top producer in real estate is to be intentional with every action you take. You can time block every minute of the week and still not sell any homes, and that’s because simply having a busy schedule isn’t enough. The things you fill your time with must have a specific purpose.

Your evenings and weekends will be particularly important, as this is when most clients will be available to meet with you. Everything you do should help put you in front of clients. This is easier said than done, though. You can’t expect to be successful if you aren’t well prepared at every step. Before you can set appointments, you need to make calls, and before you make calls, you need to write down a list of leads. Every action is connected.

“The key to being a top producer in real estate is to be intentional with every action you take.”

Intentionality is a key component to success in the real estate industry. Once you learn to be purposeful with your actions, you too can join the top 20% of agents in our business.

        <description>

Time blocking is paramount to your success in the real estate business. Here are a few of the things that you&rsquo;ll need to set aside time for in your daily schedule.

 

Today I’m going to go a little deeper on a topic we’ve discussed before: time blocking.

In order to time block effectively, you’ll need to have a good calendar. Which one should you use? From my experience, the best one to use is the one that you already use to schedule events.

Here’s what I do. First, I schedule my events with God, whether it be church, volunteer work, or other related activities. Then, I schedule my family events within my calendar. Then, I start to schedule those working hour activities so that I can fund those other parts of my life.

“In this business, you need to be available when everyone else is available.”

In this business, you need to be available when other people are available. That means that evenings and weekends are your most valuable time slots. I suggest scheduling them in two-hour time blocks because that’s usually how long an average listing presentation takes.

Once you have your evenings and weekend times blocked for appointments, start time blocking for the other dollar-producing activities you can be doing during this time. If you’re not meeting with a client, that means you need to be prospecting. When you’re proactive and calling people during those times, you also want to be intentional. Know who you’re calling when you get to the timeslot. During the day, do your preparation by getting your list together and understand that you’re looking for people who are going to buy/sell in the next two years.

If you have any questions for me about how you should be scheduling your time or about how I schedule mine, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Advertising is an essential piece to the real estate puzzle in today&rsquo;s market. Here&rsquo;s a peek at what our strategy looks like.

 

I want to continue the discussion we had in our last video: What’s the best return on investment when it comes to advertising? Last time, we talked about what to advertise, where to advertise, and who to advertise to. The one thing we didn’t answer was how to create the ad and capture information from potential clients. These are two factors that you need to figure in before implementing any kind of advertising.

Here at RE/MAX Action, we utilize a unique CRM that we provide to all of our agents. This not only creates the ad for the new listing or open house, but also captures that information from the leads we generate. It also starts the valuable conversion process by immediately responding via AI and beginning the interaction with the potential buyer or seller.

“A CRM is something you need to have.”

Simply put, you’ll need a CRM to create an ad and compile that contact information into its database with a follow-up system. This is something you need to have in place with the way today’s buyers operate.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

What advertising method has the best return on investment?

 

When it comes to creating an advertising campaign for our listings and open houses, we need to identify what we’re advertising, where we’re placing those ads, and to whom we’re trying to market our listings.

First, we need to determine the “what.” What are we going to advertise? Well, as I said, we’re advertising listings, as well as open houses for those listings.

Next, we identify the “where.” Where are we going to advertise those listings? Right now, the main portals are Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com—they’re capturing our leads and selling them back to us. Additionally, Facebook is a great vehicle for advertising our listings and open houses.

“As an end result of our efforts, the return on investment for us comes out to about one dollar per lead.”

Lastly, and probably most importantly, we need to figure out the “who.” Through Facebook’s advertising filters, we can pick and choose our target market.

As an end result of our efforts, the return on investment for us comes out to about one dollar per lead. That’s right—in exchange for advertising our listings and their accompanying open houses, we can get 30 leads for about $30.

If you’re interested in learning more about how to get such a return on your investment for advertising your listings, feel free to reach out to me. We can have a more in-depth conversation on how to get more of a bang for your buck when it comes to your advertising methods. In the meantime, have a great day!

To maximize your efficiency and effectiveness as an agent, you need to have a strategy behind the technology you use.

 

Here at RE/MAX Action, we’re known as technology pioneers, but sometimes, the use of technology in real estate is misunderstood.

There are a lot of tools out there that can help agents tremendously, but they don’t always help you be as effective as you can be. By that, I mean if you don’t have the right strategy behind the technology you use, you won’t be closing more deals in less time—you’ll be closing fewer deals and take a longer time doing it.

For example, working with buyers is all about helping them comparison-shop. In other words, we have to help buyers “self-discover” the right home for them based on their comparison shopping. That’s the strategy I use when I have a buyer who’s ready to select a home.

If I have, say, six homes for them to look at in a single home-showing run, I place the home I think they’re going to buy—based on their preferences—in the second-to-last position of the itinerary. From there, I use the order of the homes we see to build up their emotional involvement.

“If you’ve been in the business for a long time, you know that human nature doesn’t change.”

By the time they look at the last home on the schedule (which, by design, isn’t as nice as the previous one), all they can talk about is the home they just saw. That’s when I offer to take one more look at that home before wrapping things up. At that point, they’re emotionally attached to it.

The point I’m trying to make, then, is that there are plenty of technologies that can put together the shortest, fastest driving route connecting each of those six houses, but if we truly understand comparison shopping and we know what our buyers want, we’re not going to rely on some software just so we can save time. Instead, we’re going to rely on our strategic order of home showings.

If you’ve been in the business for a long time, you know that human nature doesn’t change. It’s the strategic route that allows us to be as effective and efficient as we can be—not the driving route.

If you’d like to talk more about this topic or you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you.

        <description>

Over time, what has changed regarding homebuyers&rsquo; behavior in the market? Today I&rsquo;ll discuss a trend we&rsquo;ve noticed.

 

Homebuyers usually go through what I call a ‘browsing period’—a period of time in which they’re just looking for information on homes, not necessarily to buy them straight away. This period can last anywhere from nine to 12 months, more or less.

Think about buying homes in the old days, before the internet became almost universally accessible: Buyers had browsing periods, but we browsed for homes using print advertising in magazines, newspapers, etc. We would look at print ads to get an idea of what homes’ prices were; we certainly didn’t want to be hounded by a professional real estate salesperson. At the time, we were hesitant to make that phone call to learn about the information the listing agent didn’t include in the ad.

When we did get closer to the point of actually buying a home, we finally ended up making the call to the Realtor. Then what did the Realtor do? They knew that the prospect was looking to buy sometime in the next two days, two weeks, or two months. After doing the browsing on their own, the buyer had come to a point where they were now a prospect, where they could determine what they were looking for, and how we were going to help them.

Back then, the browsing period was a lot shorter, so let’s look at what it looks like today.

“Buyers usually go through what I call a ‘browsing period.’”

Like I said, humans haven’t changed. They still want the browsing period, but we now have the ability, using the technology and tools available to us, to find out a buyer’s intentions sooner in the process. We have access to their contact information because, these days, buyers are registering with certain websites online.

It’s not that these internet leads are no good or that conversion rates are too low—when we understand that human beings are human beings, it really gives us an opportunity to help build trust. After all, a client needs to know, like, and trust the agent they work with to buy a home.

For us agents, these leads aren’t really even leads, but more like suspects; we don’t really know if they’re serious about buying or if they’re just entertaining the idea. But, because most home browsers these days are planning to move within two years, we have the chance to grow our relationship with the person during the browsing period. This way, when they get to the point of knowing they’re ready to buy, they officially become prospects.

Here at RE/MAX Action, we provide agents with the process, people, and technology to help you close more deals in less time. If you’d like more information, or if I can help you in any way, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.

You can boost your business without hiring a new employee. Here&rsquo;s how.

 

You’ve probably been told before that to take your career to the next level, you need to hire a personal assistant.

Basically, this would mean another person for you to be in charge of. First, you’d need to find them online or through some other outlet, but more importantly, you have to know what your process is and how to train them.

Right now, when you take a listing, there are 47 vital activities that must be done. Let’s say you put the listing in the MLS—now what? You need to get listing sheets, home brochures, a sign in the yard, online listings, and much, much more.

“We have a process, the technology, and people in place in order for you to grow your business.”

You know how these processes work, but what if, instead of hiring your own personal assistant, you could simply send off a processing form detailing how you want the processes completed, and they’re done for you?

That’s what we do at RE/MAX. We have a process, the technology, and people in place in order for you to grow your business. Do what you do best, and leave the rest to us.

If you’d like to increase your business with us, have any questions, or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I want to talk about the different types of brokerages to consider when it comes to the choices you have in your real estate career.

 

If you’re at a point where you want to make a major change in your real estate career—and changing brokerages is always a major change—I think it’s important to understand the different brokerage models that are out there. I’ve broken those down into three main models:

1. The traditional model. This model, which can be national, regional, or even mom-and-pop realty, works on some type of split. You’ll probably start out on a 50/50 split, which will increase based on how much you sell.

2. The “help you do nothing” model. This is more or less a holding company. Yes, agents who work in this type of brokerage pay very low monthly fees and a small transaction fee when they close a property; however, the brokerages don’t offer much in the way of assistance, leaving agents to succeed or fail on their own. Those that are really serious about being a professional real estate salesperson understand that they’re actually just  business owners; most of us need more help than you’ll get from this type of brokerage.

3. The hybrid model. This type of brokerage is transaction-based. You’ll pay some sort of monthly fee, which goes towards the technology you’ll need to keep up with the four key areas of your business: lead generation, lead conversion, following up, and marketing.

At RE/MAX Action, we work together as a team to keep you, the agent, doing what you do best: Staying in front of buyers and sellers, growing those relationships, and instilling confidence in your abilities to help clients through the process of buying or selling. Your communication skills are really key to your success in closing transactions and continuing to grow and maintain those relationships you have with buyers and sellers.

“At RE/MAX Action, we work together as a team to keep you, the agent, doing what you do best.”

So where do we come in?

As a brokerage, RE/MAX Action provides you with a few key things:

1. Brand awareness. Our brand gives clients the confidence that they’re working with a trustworthy, experienced agent.

2. Freedom from admin tasks. These tasks can take agents away from communicating with their leads and clients. Our brokerage takes care of those administrative tasks so that you can focus on what you do best.

3. Beyond technology, RE/MAX Action gives you processes and the people to help you close a transaction.

If you’d like more information about how we can work together to get you to the next level in your career, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. I’m here to help.

        <description>

There&rsquo;s a huge opportunity in our market for a specific type of homeowner. Here&rsquo;s how they can take advantage of a favorable market.

 

No matter what noise you’re hearing out there in the media right now, there are a couple of facts that you need to know about our real estate market.

First, there is a major shortage of inventory for first-time homebuyers. At the same time, we have an abundance of inventory for buyers who are looking to upgrade to a bigger and better home. If you’re able to get the message out to homeowners who have those homes that first-time homebuyers are looking for, those homeowners will realize that they have equity, they can sell their current home for a premium, and they can start building more equity in a bigger, better, and newer home.

“You need to get this message out to these homeowners.”

They’ll then be able to get a great deal on the home they purchase next because they’ll be buying in a buyer’s market. On the day of closing, they will have increased their cash net on their sale and get a huge discount on their new home. That could equal as much as a $60,000 to $80,000 swing just because of the market conditions. As they move forward, that cash equity will only increase and will be twice what it would have been if they would have stayed in their current home to begin with.

So get out there and get that message out to those owners of first-time homebuyer homes that they have a huge opportunity in the market. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

How can you keep growing your business in a down market? There are a couple of key points you need to remember.

 

With all the doom and gloom we’ve been hearing about our market lately, how is it that those of us who’ve been in the real estate industry as long as I have continue to grow our businesses?

We understand one essential truth: Everybody needs a place to live.

We also understand that us real estate agents get paid by transactions—not the market, itself. It’s our job to either maintain the relationships we have with people or grow those relationships. Since everybody needs a place to live, there are always going to be either more buyers or more sellers in the market. As professional salespeople, we need to understand and master the dialogues of working in both a buyer’s and a seller’s market. It’s as simple as that.

“We need to understand and master the dialogues of working in both a buyer’s and a seller’s market.”

So, practice mastering these dialogues and focus on transactions—not the market.

If you’d like to know more about the techniques we implement for the agents on our team or there’s anything else I can help you with, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.

It&rsquo;s time to plan your 2019 business. Here&rsquo;s where you should start.

 

I’m excited to talk about how to put a business plan together today. The simplest way to start is to figure out the dollar amount that you need to live and cover all of your expenses.

Once you have that figured out, you should make it your goal to double it. When you set a goal in your business plan, it has to be a realistic number. Once you’ve determined that goal, it’s pretty easy to figure out how many transactions you need to complete to reach that.

For example, let’s say you have an average sale price of $250,000 and an average commission of $5,000. Take your goal number, divide it by 5,000, and that’s how many transactions you’ll need to complete to get there.

Next, you’ve got to time block your life. If you owned a retail business, you know which hours that you’d be open and those would be the hours you work. In your real estate business, you also need to figure out when you’re opened and when you’re closed.

“Try to make evenings and weekends open.”

How many hours per week are you actually going to work? Once you block out your spiritual life, then your family life, you’ll be left with at least 40 hours to work. Try to make evenings and weekends open because that’s when most people are going to be available for home showings and home for you to prospect to.

Be proactive, go out, grow relationships, and get voice to voice so you can get face to face. If you stick to a plan like this, you’ll be hitting your goal every year.

If you have any questions for me or I can share any of my wisdom with you to help take your career to the next level, feel free to reach out to me via phone or email. There’s no obligation, no commitment. I’m just excited for the opportunity to help you. Hope to hear from you soon.

Here&rsquo;s how to be proactive through cold calling and door knocking.

 

Our main objective in this business is to be proactive, and cold calling and door knocking are two ways we proactively find new clients in our database.

Our goal is to meet in person with our clients, and since our money comes from when we’re voice to voice with clients on the phone—which is how we get face to face—we need to have a good way to accomplish this initial contact. We can speak over the phone and set up an appointment to get face to face, or we can go right to the source and knock on their door.

Now, how do we set up our methods to make sure we can keep an effective work-life balance in our day-to-day schedules? Here’s what I recommend:

Set aside a block of time on nights or weekends for you to make some cold calls. These blocks are now dedicated to prospecting new or potential clients. If you see nights and weekends to be too valuable of times to lose, think of it this way: When are most people available? When are people getting off work? Survey says: nights and weekends.

“Our main objective in this business is to be proactive.”

What about door knocking? This should also take place during nights and weekends, as people are home for the reasons mentioned earlier. Everyone lives somewhere, but not everyone is likely to be home during the day. When you find people who are getting home from work around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., you know they have both a job and a home, which means they can likely afford a purchase in the near future. We want to be that person, face to face, who finds out when they’re planning to move.

Whether it’s through a phone call or an in-person visit, if we find out they’re wanting to move in two years or less, we begin following up to stay on their radar. Let them know what their house is worth, send them emails with information about new homes on the market, and do anything else you can to position yourself as a helpful and professional agent.

To be successful, whether it’s through cold calling or door knocking, you have to be proactive in growing your database, maintaining it, or finding more people who will be moving soon. If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

There are two important reasons why we at RE/MAX Action are successful in our business&mdash;our agents and how we as a brokerage support those agents.

 

The real estate business is very simple, but it’s not always easy. Here are a few NAR statistics that explain what I mean:


  Eight out of every 10 agents will be out of the business in 12 months.
  87 out of every 100 agents will be out of the business in five years.
  The average agent only does four transactions per year.


Those are some pretty scary numbers, especially when you consider that if your average sale price for those four transactions was $250,000, you’d actually be living below the poverty level.

Here at RE/MAX Action, we do four times the amount of business that an average brokerage does. How? It boils down to two important factors.

“As agents, people need to know us, like us, and trust us in order to do business with us.”

The first is our agents. Our agents stay voice to voice in order to get face to face, and that should be your job too. What I mean by that is you should spend your time-blocking hours over the phone growing or maintaining the relationships you already have with the people you know.

You’re a professional real estate salesperson 24 hours a day, but life revolves around the relationships you have with people. Cold-calling people is one thing, but you also need to be there when they need to buy or sell. It’s that simple. If you stay on the phone with these people, grow your relationship with them, and provide them with real estate information, you’ll be their go-to person when it comes time to buy or sell. As agents, people need to know us, like us, and trust us in order to do business with us.

The second factor is the brokerage, itself. Remember, your broker is actually your business partner. At RE/MAX Action, when we’re your business partner, we provide the processes, the people, and the technology that enables you to grow or maintain the relationships with the people who will buy or sell through you. You’re continually growing with people who know you, like you, and trust you.

If you’d like to know more about the process, the people, and the technology behind RE/MAX Action, just give me a call. I’d be happy to sit down and talk with you.

        <description>

The support system we implement for our business partners focuses on three key areas.

 

How do we support our business partners at RE/MAX Action?

Our system focuses on three areas: the process, the people, and the technology that supports those two areas.

“You need the right processes in place, the right people running those processes at a high level, and the latest technologies at your fingertips.”

In a true business partnership, these areas are our responsibility. Your responsibility is to schedule appointments with buyers and sellers. To take care of the vital activities of a transaction, you need the right processes in place, the right people running those processes at a high level, and the latest technologies at your fingertips.

If you’d like to learn more about how we’re able to implement this support system, don’t hesitate to give me a call. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to speak to you.

        <description>

When we bring an agent onto our team, we are looking to form a true partnership. This is how we do it.

 

When I’m having a conversation with someone about how RE/MAX Action works differently than other brokerages, the main point I like to focus on is how we work together.

When you work here, you don’t work for me; you work for RE/MAX Action. We are looking to have a true partnership with each individual agent. A business partnership is only successful when both partners are giving 100% to the partnership and giving their highest and best effort to each other.

“We want to have a true partnership with each individual agent.”

A lot of times, partnerships don’t succeed because one partner is eyeing the other partner and wondering how much they are going to put in a partnership before they do anything. In our partnership, each side gives 100% and that is ultimately what makes us successful.

If you have any questions for me or would like to continue the conversation about how our philosophies and strategies can take your business to the next level, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
