When we bring an agent onto our team, we are looking to form a true partnership. This is how we do it.

When I’m having a conversation with someone who is looking to get involved with RE/MAX Action about how we work differently than other brokerages, **the main point I like to focus on is how we work together**.

When you work here, you don’t work for me; you work for RE/MAX Action. We are looking to have a true partnership with each individual agent. A business partnership is only successful when both partners are giving 100% to the partnership and giving their highest and best effort to each other.

A lot of times, partnerships don’t succeed because one partner is eyeing the other partner and wondering how much they are going to put in a partnership before they do anything. **In our partnership, each side gives 100% and that is ultimately what makes us successful**.

If you have any questions for me or would like to continue the conversation about how our philosophies and strategies can take your business to the next level, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
