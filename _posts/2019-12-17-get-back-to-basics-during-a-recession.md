<center><em>Today I&rsquo;ll explain what I meant when I told clients, &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a recession, but I just chose not to participate.&rdquo;</em></center>

<br>I don’t know about you, but I’m hearing an overwhelming amount of noise out there about a recession. It’s important to recognize in times like these that, for any market, fear is a greater motivator than the opportunity gained.

Based on what you’ve probably been hearing, you’re thinking, “Oh my gosh, what am I going to do? A recession is coming, the sky is falling, and I’ll be out of business\!”

As someone who’s gone through three “recessions” in their career, I’m here to tell you: **No, the sky isn’t falling, and there’s absolutely no reason your business can’t grow**.&nbsp;

How have so many longtime realtors managed to stay in the business and survive recessions and heavy recession speculation?

They understand the core of the business, that’s how. They remember that we get paid by the transactions, not the market. Don’t overthink it: Everyone that you know lives somewhere, right? So everyone will still have to, at some point, engage in the real estate process, whether they’re moving up, moving down, buying for the first time or selling.

Those people will still need your service, regardless of whether there are more buyers or sellers—**there are closings that happen every day in every so-called market**.

So when you hear that there’s going to be a recession, just do what I did when I entered the business during a downturn: See the inherent opportunity. If sellers will be having a harder time finding buyers, doesn’t that help us as real estate agents?

Truly, sellers in a recession will need all the professional real estate help they can get. Master you strategies and be prepared for a market with more sellers than buyers.

In short, don’t be afraid to get out there, and if you ever need my help, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to talk with you.
