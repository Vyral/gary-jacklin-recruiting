I’m sure you’ve heard all about the importance of your mindset in this business from other trainers and speakers. I’ve been thinking about this myself lately, so today I’d like to illuminate **one of the greatest “mind shifts”** that I’ve put into practice in my life and that I’ve stressed to my agents as well.

It’s a concept that many thought leaders have spoken about—the great motivational speaker and sales trainer Jim Rohn and Robert Kiyosaki in his book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” being a few examples.

**To be successful in this business, a mind shift must unavoidably take place, and that means moving away from the mental barrier of “I can’t” and toward this question: “How can I?”** That’s the mind shift I’m referring to. Therein lies the difference between the few who do so much and the many who do so little.

It sounds simple, but it’s much easier said than done and no one can do it for you. **Ultimately, you’re in charge of your own mindset**. It’s important to have an awareness of your own self-talk and to realize you’re the one thinking you can’t.

One day at a time, take a long, hard look at your goals and start asking, “How can I?” If you want to do 100 deals in a year, understand that there’s someone producing at that level. And if it’s 50, someone’s doing that too. That level of success isn’t the fruit of luck. It’s the fruit of hard work.

The bottom line is abandoning “I can’t” and embracing “How can I?” is simple to say, but takes meaningful action to implement. Start implementing this mind shift in your daily life, and you’ll see positive change.
