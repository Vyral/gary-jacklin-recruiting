&nbsp;

The real estate business is very simple, but it’s not always easy. Here are a few NAR statistics that explain what I mean:

* Eight out of every 10 agents will be out of the business in 12 months.
* 87 out of every 100 agents will be out of the business in five years.
* The average agent only does four transactions per year.

Those are some pretty scary numbers, especially when you consider that if your average sale price for those four transactions was $250,000, you’d actually be living below the poverty level.

Here at RE/MAX Action, we do four times the amount of business that an average brokerage does. How? It boils down to two important factors.

**The first is our agents**. Our agents stay voice to voice in order to get face to face, and that should be your job too. What I mean by that is you should spend your time-blocking hours over the phone growing or maintaining the relationships you already have with the people you know.

You’re a professional real estate salesperson 24 hours a day, but life revolves around the relationships you have with people. Cold-calling people is one thing, but you also need to be there when they need to buy or sell. It’s that simple. If you stay on the phone with these people, grow your relationship with them, and provide them with real estate information, you’ll be their go-to person when it comes time to buy or sell. As agents, people need to know us, like us, and trust us in order to do business with us.

**The second factor is the brokerage, itself**. Remember, your broker is actually your business partner. At RE/MAX Action, when we’re your business partner, we provide the processes, the people, and the technology that enables you to grow or maintain the relationships with the people who will buy or sell through you. You’re continually growing with people who know you, like you, and trust you.

If you’d like to know more about the process, the people, and the technology behind RE/MAX Action, just give me a call. I’d be happy to sit down and talk with you.
