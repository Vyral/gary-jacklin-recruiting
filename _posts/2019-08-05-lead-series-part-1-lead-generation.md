<center>Today marks the first part of a four-series in which I&rsquo;ll discuss tips to help with lead generation, conversion, follow-up, and marketing. We&rsquo;ll begin with lead generation.</center>

&nbsp;

Oftentimes, all we get from a potential lead is a simple email. At that stage, they’re not yet even a lead, but rather just a suspect. **In order for them to actually become a lead, you need to register them in your database**—ask them for a name, phone number, and email address. In the age of the internet, why do you need their phone number? Well, nowadays, everyone has a cell phone, meaning you’ll be able to reach them all day any day.

Many agents hesitate to do this, thinking that their clients hate to register. If that’s the case, then those people aren’t even suspects, and I wouldn’t even have the time to deal with them. **I only want to work with the ones who will give me their email address and, better, ones who won’t prompt me to spend my resources for nothing**. My job is to find actual prospects with whom I can communicate and schedule a one-on-one appointment to then help them buy or sell a home.

The real point today is that your suspects can qualify themselves at a deeper level when you ask them to register in your database. **If you don’t do that, then I don’t know what you’re looking for**.
