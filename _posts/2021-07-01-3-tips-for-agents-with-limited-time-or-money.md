There’s no denying it: Every real estate agent out there struggles with two major things. Either they don't have enough money or they don't have enough time. Here are some practical steps to address both.

**1\. Focusing on listings instead of buyers will save you time**. If you're focused on buyers, you're spending on average at least 32 hours per buyer. If you focus on listings, you're doing four times as much within the same amount of time. It takes an average of eight hours to work with a typical seller.

**2\. Only work with qualified buyers and sellers**. When I go on a listing appointment, the best listing I could have is a seller that wants to buy. That's not to say that we don't have our challenges. I've talked in the past about what we can do to help that seller deal with the fear of not finding the right house.

**3\. Do what others are unwilling to do**. There’s a reason why 10% of the agents do 90% of the business. If you're not where you want to be production-wise or you're spending too much time doing the number of transactions that you're doing, then you need to be willing to do what the others aren't willing to do and be proactive. Go back to the fundamentals, have a conversation face-to-face, and go on listing appointments. Send out about 15 to 20 simple tests to your database every day. Ask them if they know what's going on in the market and if they're at all curious as to what their home’s value is.

Go back to your past clients and text them, ask if they’re aware of what their property value is right now, then do a market analysis and get in front of them. This opens the conversation, but we're always focused on the listing. When we're focused on their listing, their fear is going to be that they can't find a home. However, since you’re being proactive and doing what others won't do, which is door-knocking and cold calling, you can find a home for them. You'll be finding other listings in the meantime. Your focus should always be on listings.
