<br>No matter what level you’ve attained in your real estate career, there will always be a level higher waiting for you. If you’re serious about leveling up, consider the value and true definition of each of these three things:

**1\. Training.** You may roll your eyes as you read that word and think, “Look, I’m not new to this industry, I don’t need training.” However, if that’s your first thought, then you’ve missed the point already; in real estate (as in most professions), the training never stops. I’m learning and getting trained on new things all of the time, and you should be too. Every professional sports team holds a training camp before the season starts.

The main concepts of how we make money in real estate will never change, but we have to be continually trained on new technologies that will help us do those core dollar-producing activities at a more efficient and effective level.

**2\. Coaching.** You have to have a coach, but exactly who qualifies as one? Let’s visit the sports team analogy: The coach doesn't train the team on the basics or even position-specific skills—they help keep each player accountable to the plays they’ve trained on. Do you have an accountability coach who’s keeping you on track to reach that next level?

**3\. Mentoring.** A mentor is someone who takes a higher level look at your business and helps you on a more consultative basis. They’ll look at your goals and methodology and do what’s called a gap analysis—an unbiased search for any gaps that may exist between the place that you claim you want to reach and the plans you’ve implemented to reach it. Ideally, your mentor should have experience not just in listing and selling but in running a team at a very high level. They should have already attained the level you’re seeking to attain.

Here at RE/MAX Action, we have a step-by-step guide for training, coaching, and mentoring, so don’t hesitate to reach out by phone or email if you want to know about that. I’m always ready to help in any way I can\!
