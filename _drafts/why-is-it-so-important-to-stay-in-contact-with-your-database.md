Your database can be a rich source of business if you keep in contact. Here’s how we do that at RE/MAX Action.

Today’s topic is a fairly simple concept, but one that can be very effective in today’s age.

Every real estate agent out there knows people. Whether it’s your family and friends, or past clients and other professional contacts. All of those people live somewhere. The majority of them own their own home. **Just by staying in touch with these people, you’ll gain trust in your relationship to hopefully help them with future moves**.

For homeowners who are looking to sell, there are really two transactions in one that you can help them with. They need to sell their home first before they buy. **Why not provide them with valuable and effective information, such as how much their home is worth?** It’s really that simple.

At RE/MAX Action, we have cutting-edge technology that automates this process to make sure we stay in touch with the people in our databases and that we’re ready to help when someone in your database is ready to buy or sell. There’s more than enough business to go around—you just have to know the right way to aggregate it.

If you have any questions for me about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
