<center><em>What does good communication with your database look like? Let&rsquo;s discuss.</em></center>

&nbsp;

In our <u><a target="_blank" href="https://joinrma.com/stay-in-touch-with-your-database-by-using-this-simple-rule.html">last message</a></u>, we spoke about when you should reach out to your database. This time, we’re going to cover what content you should offer and, really, why.

In short, the reason real estate professionals stay in touch with our database is to build and maintain relationships, because these relationships translate into business. As for what kind of content or communication you bring them, **the most important thing is that you’re providing value**.

Offering this value establishes a sense of trust. It also cements you as a reliable, knowledgeable expert in your field. To give you an example, just a couple of days ago I spoke to my friend Paul about his recent move. Paul isn’t a client—he’s someone I film webinars with. Nevertheless, when he was telling me about his real estate situation, I offered to send him occasional updates on how the market is doing in his area.

This is a perfect example of what kind of communication you can have with your database. **It really can be that simple**.
