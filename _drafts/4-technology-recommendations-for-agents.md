Today’s video is a follow-up to <u><a target="_blank" href="https://joinrma.com/why-do-agents-need-to-embrace-technology.html">my previous one</a></u>, in which I made the bold statement that agents who don’t embrace new technology will be left in the dust of ones who do.

That video prompted a lot of questions, and some folks want me to be specific as to what types of tech agents should use. What tools work the best? Let’s once again look at the four focus areas of any successful agent:

**1\. Lead generation**. Get yourself a company website and mobile app if you don’t already have one. Look into other applications such as kvCORE, BoomTown, Commissions Inc. and REDX.

**2\. Lead conversion**. Remember, our goal is to establish voice-to-voice communication so we can get face-to-face interaction. There are so many apps out there that can help you achieve this; ConstantContact is great for emails, and I also use BombBomb a lot.

**3\. Follow-up**. BombBomb is also great for this step, too, but never forget the most important tool here: your telephone. Give your under-contract client meaningful updates.

**4\. Marketing**. This step can be very confusing. If you’re buying leads, well then that’s a whole separate issue for another video. To market to your ‘suspects’ (aka your database), you must be active on Facebook and Instagram.

I’d love the opportunity to meet with you one-on-one and go over any questions you may still have on this topic. Feel free to reach out to me by phone or email anytime. With that said, go list and sell and house, and have a great day\!
