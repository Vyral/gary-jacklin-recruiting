<center style="font-size: 18px;"><br /><em>Here&rsquo;s how to make your first hiring decision a good one.</em></center>

<br>If you want to grow your production and get to the next level, hiring an assistant is a must. As I’ve touched on in previous videos, it’s vital that agents stay focused on those core dollar-productive activities. Everything that’s not vital to a transaction is still relevant, but it should be handled by someone else that you can trust. What’s the process that drives your business forward? What do you need to know, do, and have to hire the right person and train them adequately on that process?

Many agents think that hiring someone just because they’ve been in real estate before is a good call. Truth be told, experience moving through the revolving door of real estate is no reason to hire someone.

**I’ve put together a free, downloadable guide designed to help you hire the ideal assistant**. Just give me a call, text, or email and I’ll get that right out to you. I’d also be more than happy to answer any other questions on how to leverage your business in a very effective and efficient way. Let’s have a conversation soon; today is a perfect time to start breaking through to that next level\!
