Your mindset will make all the difference in whether you reach your goals this year. It’s the difference between those who consistently produce at a high rate and those who never quite get what they need and eventually wash out of the business. **You have one of the best opportunities because you’re self-employed.** That ultimately means that if you work, you make money, and if you don’t work, you don’t make money.&nbsp;

Everything is in your control when you look at things the right way. The proper mindset is that you know people, they all live somewhere, they’ll get older, and they’ll eventually have to move. Their lifestyle will change, they’ll upsize or downsize, or something else.&nbsp;

**External factors are always present, but they have nothing to do with whether you’ll achieve your goals.** Rates will be increasing or decreasing, a recession is happening and then it isn’t, there’s inflation going on and then it isn’t. Despite what’s happening, you can still fund a great life for yourself and your family. You have choices; it’s all how you look at things.&nbsp;

Stay positive, turn off the external noise, and remember that the set of your sail is what determines what will happen. We have two sets of dialogues: one for sellers and one for buyers, and in between, we’re always in a transitioning market.

You also need to be proactive; another advantage to being self-employed is that you can choose what you do today. No one can fire you, but **you’re the one who has to go out and do the crucial activities to keep yourself in front of people.** Keep it simple: Know the seller you’re working with this week, know the buyer you’re working with this week, and you need a listing and a sale.&nbsp;

Go back to the sellers who decided not to list because there are many good reasons they should do so now. Then go back to the buyers who were fatigued by the market and decided to wait. Share new information with hesitant clients. Use the visuals you have to make your case for why they should buy or sell with you.&nbsp;

Right now, there’s likely $50,000 to $100,000 of unearned commission you could be getting from people who already know, like, and trust you. Help them do what’s in their best interest, which is taking advantage of this excellent real estate market. When all the other agents are zigging, you zag, and **seize the opportunities.**

If you have any questions or would like a more personal one-on-one meeting with me to go deeper into some of these things, please call, text, or email me. I can teach you some strategies to get that unrealized income. Go help someone today\!
