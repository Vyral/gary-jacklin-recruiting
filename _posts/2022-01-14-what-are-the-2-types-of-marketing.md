All the time, I hear the word ‘marketing’ being thrown around—“I’m going to do more marketing,” or “I need to change my marketing.” Well, there are actually two types of marketing, and today I’ll discuss what they are and how you can optimize your strategies.&nbsp;

The first type of marketing is **exposure advertising**. This is where you market to expose yourself; in other words, you’re marketing so that your consumers will see you everywhere.

The second type of marketing is **lead generation marketing**. That’s where the consumer contacts *you* for help buying or selling a house.&nbsp;

Many agents waste a lot of money because they don’t understand the difference between the two types. Before you spend a dime on marketing, you need to understand what you’re trying to accomplish and what your return on investment will be.&nbsp;

Additionally, you need to track your marketing. If you’re doing lead generation, keep track of your leads and where they come from. If it’s exposure advertising, keep track of where people are hearing about you.
