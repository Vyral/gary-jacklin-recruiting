<center><em>Time blocking is paramount to your success in the real estate business. Here are a few of the things that you&rsquo;ll need to set aside time for in your daily schedule.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Today I’m going to go a little deeper on a topic we’ve discussed before: time blocking.

**In order to time block effectively, you’ll need to have a good calendar**. Which one should you use? From my experience, the best one to use is the one that you already use to schedule events.

**Here’s what I do**. First, I schedule my events with God, whether it be church, volunteer work, etc. Then, I schedule my family events within my calendar. Then, I start to schedule those working hour activities so that I can fund those other parts of my life.

In this business, you need to be available when other people are available. That means that evenings and weekends are your most valuable time slots. **I suggest scheduling them in two-hour time blocks because that’s usually how long an average listing presentation takes**.

Once you have your evenings and weekends times blocked for appointments, start time blocking for the other dollar-producing activities you can be doing during this time. **If you’re not meeting with a client, that means you need to be prospecting**. When you’re proactive and calling people during those times, you also want to be intentional. Know who you’re calling when you get to the timeslot. During the day, do your preparation by getting your list together and understand that you’re looking for people who are going to buy/sell in the next two years.

If you have any questions for me about how you should be scheduling your time or about how I schedule mine, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
