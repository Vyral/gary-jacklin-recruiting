Today I'm talking about how to overcome the No. 1 objection that sellers have about listing their homes right now. Sellers are saying, “I'm not going to list my house because I'm afraid I won't find a home to purchase.” So how do we overcome their fear of homelessness?

**1\. Discuss everything thoroughly with the client**. We go into this in a very methodical way. We have our plan and share that with the client so they can have confidence in us that by implementing all of these strategies as part of our marketing plan, we'll find them a home.

**2\. Organize a rent-back agreement**. Possession is different than closing, so if we buy some time by delaying the closing, it can be risky. I'd rather work with possession. In multiple-offer situations, work with the offer that will do an extended possession where the seller can rent back at the buyer's price.

**3\. Leverage your time to find listings for your clients**. When sellers won't list because they can't find a home to buy, that's the perfect opportunity for the specific buyer dialogue. That's strategy\! If you are unaware of what that is, <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://join.gochicagolandhomes.com/ask/0f71d6291fda676980a5ebfe3bee64c6">click here to download the specific buyer script</a></u>. Now we need to go out to the marketplace the seller told you they like. Now you're leveraging your time to find the perfect home for that particular seller.

In the meantime, you're going to find other listings and other people that are moving. That's how you fill your pipeline listings in the future. By doing this, you will also find a home for another client. This becomes part of your arsenal of marketing plans when you're working with the seller. When you're on that listing appointment, do what the other agents are unwilling to do. Make phone calls and knock on doors to find listings for your particular buyer.

If you would like more specifics on exactly how to go about doing that, call, text, or email me. I’d be happy to answer any questions for you. Have a great day.
