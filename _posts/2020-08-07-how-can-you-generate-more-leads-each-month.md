<br>In our business, leads are everything. If you’re looking to increase the number of leads you get each month, try the following three tips:

**1\. Strategize where and how to advertise**. We’ve found that Facebook is an incredible resource, but it’s also a matter of how you use it. Are you doing targeted ads? Are you retargeting your ads? Are you including video? In today’s market, you absolutely should implement video into your strategy.

**2\. Budget for six months of advertising**. A good strategy is great, but if you have no budget, it won’t do you any good. Take a step back and look at what you can afford with a six-month commitment. I’d suggest at least $100 per month. At RE/MAX Action, we know our numbers; buyer leads are just under $2 apiece.&nbsp;

**3\. Use the right tools.** To not only capture those leads, but to also convert them into actual transactions, you need a robust CRM with automated integration. That will help you engage those leads to work with you. RE/MAX actually provides this tool, which means tens of thousands of commission dollars for our agents.

If you don’t have a CRM or need help finding the right one that will work for you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. The right tool for you is out there. Hope to hear from you soon\!
