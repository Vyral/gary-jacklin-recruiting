Today I'm going to share three things you need to know to maintain your commission dollars when working with competitive sellers:

1. **Have a positive mindset.** It’s no secret that we have a lack of inventory. Don’t get down; look on the bright side. Instead of an inventory shortage, view it as an abundance of buyers.
2. **Know what value you provide as an agent.** You're going to be competing, so you need to believe in your worth. I'll share some helpful hints in the [free download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wa628QIYaTvhNT_pgFkFkarfNHLMRz8f/view). When you’re valuable, you gain both trust and business from sellers.
3. **Know what to say, when to say it, and how to say it.** The way you show your value is also extremely important. I’ve included some useful dialogues to illustrate your value in the free download as well.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. There’s absolutely no obligation. I’d love to help you.
