<br>There’s an adage in the real estate business: If you’re not busy, get yourself busy. In other words, if you don’t have enough listings, then you need to get out there and find them. Today I’ll share the four steps it takes to get more listings quickly:

**1. Use your phone’s contact records**. When was the last time you stopped playing with your CRM and actually called these contacts? Agents often have anywhere from 800 to 3,000 contacts on their phones.  You can download these contacts to your desktop and call them from there.

**2. Call to check in and see what’s happening**. Many people are frustrated right now due to being constricted to their homes, and they want to move. Our low inventory is often what holds them back from selling. If there aren’t enough listings, you need to get out there and find them. Reach out to me for a script you can use to find listings for sellers who will need to buy once they’ve listed their homes. You can use it to create a personal listing network of those people who are willing to show their homes to specific buyers.

**3. Start filling your pipeline**. Fill your pipeline with your inventory of people who may move when they find something to buy first. This will give you listings. In the meantime, it will also help you find other potential sellers who may want to move.

**4. Just do it**. Put these strategies into action. Once you’ve made 50 to 60 calls, I bet you’ll be very busy listing and selling homes.

If you have any questions or would like more information about our specific buyer strategy, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
