Everyone wants to achieve their goals, but it’s often easier said than done. Today I want to give you four tips you can use to consistently hit your goals:

**1\. It must be in writing**. I encourage you to look through your junk drawer, the cloud, or wherever you keep your files and find your goal. If you haven’t already written it down, do it now. Think about where you want to be 12 months from now, and put it in ink.

**2\. Track your goals**. Take a look at what you want, and compare it to where you are. If you don’t track your progress, you’ll have no idea how to hold yourself accountable.

**3\. Keep it updated**. Your goal will probably develop over time. Some things work, and others don’t work. When you have it in writing and track your progress, it should be easier to do more of what works and less of what doesn’t. Make sure you set deliberate time aside to update your goals.

**4\. Enjoy your successes and the journey**. When you find success and you achieve your goals, take time to appreciate how far you’ve come. You can even use the first three steps to set up a vacation plan and get the most out of your relaxation.

If you follow these steps, you should find yourself achieving your goals on a more consistent basis. Check out our free workbook to help you get started. If you have any questions, please call or email me. I am always here to help.
