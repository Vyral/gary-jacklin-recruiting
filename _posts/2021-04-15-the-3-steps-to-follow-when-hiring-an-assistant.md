A while ago, I talked about how to navigate the process of hiring an assistant. Afterward, I had a lot of people reaching out to me and asking for more information about this process, so I thought it’d be helpful to provide an overview of the three key steps to follow. Here’s what you should do when hiring an assistant for your real estate business:

**1\. Understand which vital activities are most relevant**. There are vital tasks that must be done in a real estate business, but not all of them are relevant to you as an agent. You want to be focused on the dollar-productive activities and leave the behind-the-scenes work to your assistant.

**2\. Know the strengths and weaknesses of the position**. After you know what your assistant will focus on, you need to figure out what strengths they’ll need to have. Will your assistant be doing a lot of paperwork, for example? In that case, you want someone who’s very detail-oriented.

**3\. Know how their characteristics align with the position**. A DiSC assessment can be incredibly helpful when going through potential candidates and making sure their strengths align with what you’re looking for. For example, you may want someone who’s more cautious or someone who’s very compassionate. The DiSC assessment can help you discover these traits in candidates before choosing who to hire.

I’d be happy to share the resources I use with you. And if you have any questions about hiring an assistant or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
