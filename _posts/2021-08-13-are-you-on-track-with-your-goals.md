I’m apologizing ahead of time because I’m going to give you a kick in the teeth you may need. Today I’m discussing your 2021 goals.

You need to take a look at your main goal and **ask yourself, “Am I on track to achieve my goal by the end of the year?”** You only have about four months left to achieve your goal, so if you’re not on track to reach it, you aren’t spending enough time in the four dollar-producing activities of listing, selling, negotiating, and prospecting. If you’re currently thinking to yourself, “I do this full time, but it’s such a wacky market\!” I have a couple of questions you should ask yourself.

Are you uploading, downloading, and creating? You’re not going to make money doing those things because they’re not dollar-productive activities. How much time are you spending with buyers? **You should be focusing on growing your career, which means working with listings and sellers.**

You need voice to voice to get a face to face appointment. You want to target sellers because on average, one buyer will take up 32 hours of your time, while a seller will only take up eight. We’ve discussed only working with qualified buyers in the past, and they’re those who also have a home to sell. If you’re focused on speaking with sellers every day, the majority of them will also buy a home.

My goal today was to rattle your cage, get you back on track, and help you hit your goal. **If you’re not on track to reach your goal by the end of 2021, we need to talk.&nbsp;**
