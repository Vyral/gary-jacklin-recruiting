<center><em>These are the apps every agent needs.<br />If you want to get ahold of me, <u><a href="tel:6306382600">give me a call or send a text</a></u>!</em></center>

<br>Here are the four apps you must have as a real estate agent:

**1\. <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.showingtime.com/mobile-app/">ShowingTime</a></u>**. Being a busy agent servicing your clients also means managing their showings. If you download this app, you’ll be using it every day, and I highly recommend using it to its full potential.

**2\. <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sentrilock.com/sentrikey-real-estate/">SentriLock</a></u>**. This app makes it easier to access and show properties because the documentation is provided for you.

**3\. A buyer cost analysis app and seller net analysis app**. Many title companies offer a free app, and I use the app provided by <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ctic.com/mobileapps/">Chicago Title</a></u>. It’s simple, robust, and you can always upgrade it. It’s set up to serve the Chicago metro area, and it’s a powerful tool to help close a buyer when they’re walking through a home.

**4\. An app for filing legal paperwork**. This is a great way to access all of your pending transactions and the accompanying legal paperwork. It’s more or less a filing system for your contracts, forms, listing sheets, and social media material. If you need help managing this type of app, give me a call and I’d be happy to tell you what we at RE/MAX Action use. It’s a free tool that we control at the office level, so everything is provided for you—no uploading or downloading necessary.

If you’d like to know more about tools that can make you more productive as an agent, or if you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.
