Where are you regarding your goals?

If you’re nowhere near reaching them, you have to decide what you’re going to do about it. The end of the year is coming, and time doesn’t stop for anyone. **The way we approach this situation on our team is by using the GPS strategy (goal, plan, strategy)**. How do you enact this strategy yourself?

First, your goal must be written down. Then, the planning and strategy part will cover how you’re going to get there. After that, you need some input—who have you talked to in the last 30 days, or when you originally set your goal? If you’re not where you want to be, go to that person and discuss your goal with them.

Oftentimes, I hear people who haven’t reached their goal say that they need to “lower” their goal because it was unrealistic in the first place. This kind of thing starts with who you initially discuss your goal with. This isn’t to say that it’s too late to reach your goal. It’s never too late, and you could set your yearly goal right now if you wanted to.

Most importantly, though, **remember to write your goal down, have a plan and strategy for that goal, and get some input on why you’ve either exceeded your goal or haven’t met it**. Ask yourself why you are where you are and how you can go where you want to be.

If you’d like to talk more about establishing your own GPS or you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d be happy to speak with you.
