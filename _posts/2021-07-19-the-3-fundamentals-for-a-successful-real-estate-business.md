There are three fundamentals that can help guarantee your success as a real estate agent. If you follow and build upon these foundations, you can ensure that your business thrives. **Here’s what you need to do:**

**1\. Build it first:** Anything that is built must first be envisioned, but you have to come up with a plan to make it happen. You need to have a written business plan that will help you accomplish your goals.

**2\. Be intentional:** Sticking to the plan means adhering to a schedule. You need to block out time to get things done, and you need to be fully present in your activities. You have your family life and your spiritual life, and now you need your business life. When you’re working, remove distractions and focus on growing your business.

**3\. Focus on the major things:** In sales, you can’t get bogged down in minor processes—you need to put your energy into the things that truly matter. It can be easy to “prepare to prepare” for minor things like updating databases or uploading Facebook posts. The major things come from instances where you are “in the presence of” clients, prospects, and others who make you revenue. Look at your schedule, see where you spend your time, and make sure you’re using the majority of it in the presence of clients. Delegate the minor things to others.

If you’d like to go deeper into these concepts, or if you’d like to learn more about growing your business, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to helping you soon.
