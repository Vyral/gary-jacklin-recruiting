<br>Conflict only exists where expectations differ. Part of what you need when prospecting for clients is a discussion regarding roles and expectations. You’ll also need a signed agreement from the seller, as well as a written roles and expectations tool to use. Here’s how each of them should go.

**First, you should have a sit down with your seller about the roles and expectations for both of you**. We need to be on the same page to have a successful, win-win sale. With those expectations clearly set, it’s now time to make an agreement.

**After we make that agreement in principle, it’s time to put it in writing**. It’s not a bad idea to have it be part of your marketing plan. You can spell out what kind of communication your client can expect from you each week regarding showing feedback, marketing results, etc. It also lays out your expectations of the seller, including keeping their home clean and ready for showings. This tool is critical.
