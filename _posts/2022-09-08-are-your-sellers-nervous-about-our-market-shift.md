How can you handle seller objections? As the market shifts, many of your clients are likely worried about inflation, price reductions, and interest rates. I’ve been in this business for a long time, so let me share some of my favorite ways to handle seller objections.

If a client is concerned about inflation, remind them that real property is one of the best hedges against it. During inflationary times, property values increase with prices. If your seller wants to upgrade their property, they’ll accrue even more equity than they would otherwise.&nbsp;

What if your client wants to wait for the economy to get better? **[I’ve put together some slides that address this question;](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ou8G1gM1aps_YoquLNpKP7m6RUQvCysJ/view){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** you can check them at 1:12 in the video above. Just email me if you’d like to receive a copy.

One of the things my slides address is that demand isn’t going to crater anytime soon. As long as that is the case, property values won’t fall. Home values are a function of supply and demand, not how the economy is doing. In fact, housing prices usually stay steady or increase during a recession.&nbsp;

Finally, many sellers are concerned interest rates will continue to rise. Let them know that interest rates tend to decrease during recessions. They can make a move now and refinance when rates fall soon. On top of that, supply remains low. **Sellers still have the advantage, but we aren’t sure how long that will last.&nbsp;**

A picture is worth a thousand words, so don’t forget to email me for those slides. As always, you can call or email me with any questions. I look forward to hearing from you\!&nbsp;
