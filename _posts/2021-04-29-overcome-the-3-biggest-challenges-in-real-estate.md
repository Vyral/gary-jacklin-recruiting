When it comes to the biggest challenges facing agents today, there are three that come to mind right away. I’m going to go through each of them and show you how to overcome them:

**1\. Time.** We all have the same 24 hours in the day, but why are some of us more productive than others? One of the big factors is learning to say “no.” It’s not that you don’t want to help somebody out, but it can often get you off track. If it’s not going to interrupt your focus, by all means, help. However, sometimes you just need to say “I’d love to, but I can’t right now.”&nbsp;

Keeping your focus is also important. Prioritize specific activities for specific periods of the day. You should be spending two hours prospecting every day and pre-scheduling your appointments. The most dollar-productive times are evenings and weekends. Prioritize them in this order: Listings → buyer appointments → prospecting time.&nbsp;

**2\. Money.** This is critical to our business and success. You are the CEO of your business as a real estate agent. Are you holding your money accountable? You need to know why you’re paying for something, what you’re getting back from the money you are spending, and whether or not you truly need to purchase something based on your budget. Everyone is going to try to sell you the “easy” button, but it doesn’t exist.

**3\. People.** You have a team whether you realize it or not. It might just be your broker. You need leadership to help you sustain and grow your business. Do you have a mentor you trust? A coach that holds you accountable?&nbsp;

You also want to have access to training to master the basic skills so you can become a more profitable agent. Your admin staff is important as well. Have you really leveraged this staff? If you’re doing it all yourself, you’re just an unpaid secretary.

**These questions barely scratch the surface of what you need to be a successful real estate agent.** At RE/MAX Action, we’re focused on you working smarter, not harder. I have a step-by-step plan that I’d love to share with you; just reach out to me, and I’ll send you a copy.
