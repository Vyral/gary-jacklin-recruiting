<center><em>What advertising method has the best return on investment?</em></center>

&nbsp;

When it comes to creating an advertising campaign for our listings and open houses, we need to identify what we’re advertising, where we’re placing those ads, and to whom we’re trying to market our listings.

**First, we need to determine the “what.”** What are we going to advertise? Well, as I said, we’re advertising listings, as well as open houses for those listings.

**Next, we identify the “where.”** Where are we going to advertise those listings? Right now, the main portals are [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com){: target="_blank"}, [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/){: target="_blank"}, and [Realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/){: target="_blank"}—they’re capturing our leads and selling them back to us. Additionally, [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com){: target="_blank"}is a great vehicle for advertising our listings and open houses.

Lastly, and probably most importantly, **we need to figure out the “who.”** Through Facebook’s advertising filters, we can pick and choose our target market.

As an end result of our efforts, the return on investment for us comes out to about one dollar per lead. That’s right—in exchange for advertising our listings and their accompanying open houses, we can get about $30 for 30 leads.
