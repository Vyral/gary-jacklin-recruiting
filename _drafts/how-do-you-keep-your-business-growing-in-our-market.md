<center>How can you keep growing your business in a down market? There a couple of key points you need to remember.</center>

With all the doom and gloom we’ve been hearing about our market lately, how is it that those of us who’ve been in the real estate industry as long as I have continued to grow our businesses?

We understand one essential truth: **Everybody needs a place to live**.

We also understand that us real estate agents get paid by transactions—not the market, itself. It’s our job to either maintain the relationships we have with people or grow those relationships. Since everybody needs a place to live, there are always going to be either more buyers or more sellers in the market. As professional salespeople, we need to understand and master the dialogues of working in both a buyer’s and a seller’s market. It’s as simple as that.

So, **practice mastering these dialogues and focus on transactions—not the market**.

If you’d like to know more about the techniques we implement for the agents on our team or there’s anything else I can help you with, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
