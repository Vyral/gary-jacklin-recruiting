Advertising is an essential piece to the real estate puzzle in today’s market. Here’s a peek at what our strategy looks like.

I want to continue the discussion we had in our last video: **[What’s the best return on investment when it comes to advertising?](https://joinrma.com/what-advertising-strategies-bring-the-best-return.html){: target="_blank"}** Last time, we talked about what to advertise, where to advertise, and who to advertise to. **The one thing we didn’t answer was how to create the ad and capture information from potential clients**. These are two factors that you need to figure in before implementing any kind of advertising.

Here at RE/MAX Action, we utilize a unique CRM that we provide to all of our agents. This not only creates the ad for the new listing or open house, but also captures that information from the leads we generate. It also starts the valuable conversion process by immediately responding via AI and beginning the interaction with the potential buyer or seller.

**Simply put, you’ll need a CRM to create an ad and compile that contact information into its database with a follow-up system**. This is something you need to have in place with the way today’s buyers operate.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
